In Freudian psychology, it refers to the attribution of one's own feelings to another.  In a broader sense, it resembles the flattening of a three-dimensional image onto a two-dimensional surface.  Mathematically, projection is a function transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one (e.g., a cube projected onto a plane).  Crucially, this process is generally irreversible without additional information beyond the projection itself.  Think of Plato's cave allegory: shadows alone don't reveal the objects casting them. Similarly, a child viewing shadow puppets cannot reconstruct the puppets themselves from the shadows alone.\n\nLiterature, however, possesses a unique capacity. The act of writing can be viewed as a "projection downwards," condensing complex emotions into concise metaphors.  Reading, conversely, involves "unprojection"—interpreting these metaphors and reconstructing their multidimensional origins.  This unprojection relies on a shared code between author and reader, a pact whose stability is inherently precarious.  As Paul de Man suggests, reading is writing, and writing is reading, implying a constant, individual negotiation of meaning.\n\n**Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:**\n\nNabokov's predecessors explored the compression of objects into images (projection), and even, as seen in *Jane Eyre*, the process of decompression through unreliable narrators. However, Nabokov uniquely separates consciousnesses in *Pale Fire*, exceeding the capabilities of previous writers.  This is not about interpreting Kinbote's narrative to a higher dimension, but rather analyzing the *interpretive functions* themselves. The novel becomes a study of the interplay between Shade's poem (the projection), and Kinbote's commentary (the attempted unprojection), resulting in a complex interplay of shadows and reflections.  Kinbote's interpretation serves as a "pale, lunar luminescence," illuminating the poem's shadow and transforming it into something new.\n\n\n**Gradus: A Character of Contradictions:**\n\nGradus embodies the novel's central themes. Kinbote relentlessly mocks him, reducing him to a mere reflection of Charles's fantastical journey devoid of humanity. Yet, Gradus's role is far more complex and requires further investigation within the framework of projection and unprojection presented here.  The presentation will continue to explore this character in greater depth, analyzing his contradictory nature within the context of Nabokov's unique literary technology.	0	{"length": 2880, "index": 0}

While Charles's journey—from the palace to the port, through Paris and Switzerland, a visit to Villa Disa, and finally America—is detailed in the Index (page 306),  the specifics of this journey, except for its beginning and end, and the brief Villa Disa episode, are revealed only through Gradus's perspective.\n\n**The Dreamlike Nature of Villa Disa:**\n\nEvidence suggests Charles's visit to Villa Disa is largely a dream.  On page 206, Charles's arrival is described as a sudden appearance amidst garlands of shade.  Pages 210-213 detail his dreams of the villa's inhabitant, characterized by tender affection, awareness of her unrequited love, and a haunting confession (perhaps of homosexuality). The offer of lodging for "forty Arabian thieves" (page 213) fulfills the dreamlike requirements.  His dreams conclude on page 211, with a glimpsed smile that vanishes upon closer inspection.  The sequence ends on page 214 with a vision of a white figure, later revealed to be Fleur, not the villa's inhabitant. This reveals the dreamlike nature of the whole encounter.\n\n**Gradus as the Architect of Charles's Journey:**\n\nIt's Kinbote's narration of Gradus that constructs Charles's journey from Zembla to America, excluding the actual events in those locations.  Page 177 (in a parenthetical Gradus section) notes Charles reclining on a Parisian sofa, the same sofa Gradus occupies.  Page 200 reveals "The King was here," scrawled in charcoal at the lavender villa that Gradus both defiles and potentially creates. Thus, without Gradus, is there a Zemblan King Charles?  Does Odon's escape depend on Nodo's card-shuffling (page 150), which sets Gradus in pursuit of the king?\n\nGradus functions as structural support for Kinbote's fantasy, not just in form and language (his movement through caesuras and rhymes), but also in the narrative itself.  He allows Kinbote—and us—to see and create the journey.\n\n**Gradus and Aesthetic Consummation:**\n\nThis process-based view of Gradus aligns with Bakhtin's concept of heroic creation through the bestowal of death (as interpreted by Naiman in his chapter on Hermophobia).  Bakhtin states that "memory begins to act as a gathering and completing force from the very first moment of the hero's appearance; the hero is born in this memory (of his death)... in this sense we could say that death is the form of the aesthetic consummation of an individual" (Naiman 116).  Shade's preterist tendencies—recognizing death in every moment—culminate in this aesthetic consummation when *Pale Fire* is released from its earthly confines and enters Kinbote's grasp through Shade's murder by Gradus.\n\nGradus is both the facilitator of this consummation (carrying the poem's prosaic interpretation and enabling its apotheosis) and a frustrating, common mechanism that can only enable, never participate.  On page 154, Gradus guides the carving but never partakes.\n\n**Gradus's Multiplicity:**\n\nThis polyvalent role requires Gradus to exist not only as Gradus, but also as d'Argus, Jacques de Grey, and Jack Grey—specific narrative instances of the endless Gradus.  Jack Grey's tragic end (page 299) is a gesture of despair, not a clockwork malfunction.  However, even Jack's death does not end the function of Gradus (page 301). Regardless of Kinbote's fate or future interpretations, a "bigger, more respectable, and more competent Gradus" awaits.	1	{"length": 3545, "index": 1}

I finished it in a cafe, right about the same time I finished my coffee and my cherry cake. The cafe is in a beach town in Japan, where I have been for a very long time. Soon enough I’ll go home.\n\nWhen I say I have been here for a very long time, I mean that. I’ve been here for six months, which doesn’t sound very long until you remember that I’m twenty years old and that when you’re twenty years old six months can be a lifetime. A lot can change in six months. You can do a lot. You can get sick. You can get better. You can buy umbrellas. You can lose them. You can make friends. You can lose them. You can fall in love, and you can lose the love. You can find yourself. You can lose that, too.\n\nThere was a girl I met here, and after every date we would go for a walk. We went on a lot of walks together, just the two of us. I think it was five walks but each walk was very long and because they were the longest walks I had ever been on, just the two of us, we walked very far and covered a lot of distance. At least I did. I don’t think she moved very much if I’m being perfectly honest, but that’s okay. I moved enough for the both of us.\n\nWhen you think about it five walks is not a lot of walks. And at the end of the fifth walk it became very clear to me that the last one hadn’t been a real walk but a fake one, that like a lot of final moments it only meant something as an echo of previous moments and couldn’t stand up on its own.\n\nIt would be okay except I have a problem. I dream about her quite often. I’ll be falling asleep on the train and suddenly I’ll be dreaming about her. Or I’ll wake up early in the morning with barely enough energy to drag myself on that miserable walk to work, and I’ll realize I spent the whole night dreaming about her.\n\nI’m not sure what to do about it to be honest because I realized quite a long time ago that it wasn’t going to happen and I was sad for a while and then I was less sad for a while and then I suppose I was back to normal. So no matter how much I think about it, I can’t seem to figure out why I dream about her so often, or what to do. We don’t even have sex in the dreams, either. That would be normal I think. In the dreams we just sit next to each other and talk, or walk and talk, or go to some building and talk. We don’t talk about much.\n\nI think I might be in love with her, or at least some part of me wants me to think I am, which is especially odd because I don’t think I know anything about her. And I’m confident she doesn’t know anything about me. But I know that a very subtle, very attractive accent creeps into her voice when she says sorry, and that when she’s eating it matters to her if I’m eating too, and that every so often her smile gets so sweet the rest of the world looks bitter by comparison.\n\nI think if I had someone to talk to I wouldn’t have fallen in love with her, which probably means I never really did. But boys like me aren’t supposed to feel like this. I know that much for sure.\n\nWhen I finished *A Farewell to Arms* and my coffee and my cherry cake today in a cafe in Japan I almost cried, and though I didn’t I guess I looked very sad because the fat French man sitting at the table next to me kept looking over at me as if he were confused. I’m cursed with big eyes. Boys like me aren’t supposed to have feelings like this, but when they do they especially aren’t supposed to look like they have them. It’s off-putting. But when I get emotional I look it, and since people aren’t trained to recognize sadness in a face like mine they assume my face is wrong for some other reason. Trust me, I’m a good read of faces. Mine can be very off-putting.\n\nI like to think my best quality as a writer is that I’m honest. No matter what I write I’m honest. Even when I’m lying I’m telling the truth, and because I spend every moment of every day lying I really know what it means to tell the truth. But it’s a double-edged sword. When I’m being honest even though I am still lying I also have to tell the truth, and when I tell the truth everyone can see how much I’ve been lying, so I have to write pieces like this and keep them hidden somewhere no one will see. It’s a real problem. I’m cursed with big eyes.\n\nAnyway in this book, *A Farewell to Arms*, a man falls in love with a woman and she gets pregnant and has a baby and both she and the baby die in childbirth and that’s the ending. You might be mad at me for spoiling it right now, but I promise you’ll forget because endings don’t stick in the mind if you didn’t spend any time with the middle. Endings are just words. You know they’re coming and you know nothing is coming after that, so just like how the middle only matters because you’re on the way to an ending an ending doesn’t matter because there’s nothing coming next.\n\nI’ve been in Japan for six months, but when I think about it I’ve only been in Japan for three months. That was when I realized it wasn’t	0	{"length": 5000, "index": 0}

Someone might say that the first three months were Japan and the second three months were just normal life, and someone else might say that the second three months were Japan and the first three months were something entirely different. Having lived all six I can see both sides.\n\nYou have to understand that this story only makes sense if I was never in love. If I’m in love it makes a different kind of sense, but a crazy one, and you really would have to be warped to understand it much less live it. But if I’m not in love that means this isn’t a crazy story and that all I’ve done here is learn something very important and very true which might be even scarier than being crazy.\n\nI came to this beach town today to finish reading this book and to start writing a new chapter of my own, and I came here to swim. But the waves weren’t big enough to make it worth getting wet. So I left the beach and I walked to the cafe, and since I had been planning on swimming I wasn’t wearing any underwear, which with the shorts I was wearing made me feel very exposed, very outlined if you know what I’m saying. I don’t think anyone noticed, though. Which is interesting because I think if I were a girl I would notice.\n\nI notice a lot about girls who are strangers, especially the little things. I mean yes I notice how pretty their face is and I notice what they’re wearing and how big their breasts are and all of that stuff. But I also notice the precise tone of their voice, and how happy or sad they are based on the way they walk, and whether they seem to like little kids or hate them. The odd thing is that once I know a girl, or at least want to know her, I don’t notice any of that. I won’t notice if she got a haircut or if the clothes she’s wearing look particularly nice today. I’ll have already picked the things I want to notice, like how pretty the accent in her voice is when she says sorry, and I’ll notice those things no matter what. And of course I’ll spend the whole time trying to make her laugh.\n\nI think I’d better stop writing this. You’ve been patient enough with me, reading all this way. I just needed to find someone to talk to about the ending of *A Farewell to Arms*. After his wife and baby died the main character didn’t seem to have anything else left to write, and so he stopped, but I needed someone to keep going with. I guess I wanted to cry a little bit at just how lost he seemed to feel on the page after the last page where there was just empty space because he didn’t know how to finish.\n\nAnd when I looked up *A Farewell to Arms* online the first thing I read was some analysis about how early in the book when she slaps him she demonstrates agency against the patriarchy but later on because she says she would do whatever he wants since she’s in love with him she lost her agency. And that all made me feel a whole different kind of sad, because I think the author of *A Farewell to Arms* had big eyes just like me which people refused to see, or at least was an alcoholic. So I needed to write something down.\n\nOnce I finished the book and the cherry cake and the coffee there was a closed book and an empty plate and an empty mug sitting in front of me. They looked very nice just sitting there like that. I guess I wanted more but there wasn’t anything left. Soon I’ll be leaving Japan. It’s probably a good thing. I did everything I wanted to do here, or at least I tried, so I’ve got to be ready to go home. After all, I’ve been away for a very long time.\n\n\nPiece 2:\nIn Throes\n\nBefore I start the walk from my apartment to the park, I study my palms. There are all types of lines and marks and crossings there, running north and south and west, too. When I was a kid, I worried endlessly at the long, tapering streak which swelled just below my pinky, only to reach an undignified end just before my pointer finger. Back then, still ballooning into the world, I would caress each line, and wonder.\n\nAfter reviewing both palms, I return my left hand to my side and use the right to lock the door behind me. As I step out into the street, I realize it is past eleven. Music is playing from bars nearby, lit neon red signs and people spilling out from saloon doors into the street where they step around homeless sleepers and dodge hand-in-pocket passers-by.\n\nTurning right into a darker alley which leads to the park, I imagine I blend into the night. That I am just a silhouette, an invisible shade garbed in a black up-turned coat and chocolate brown skin who can melt into the void of the unlit facades.\n\nFor a long time I did not walk alone. We walked together—there used to be two of us, because there is supposed to be another—in the early mornings when people are with their dogs and smile at strangers. When I think back, I wonder if I knew what I was about to not have. I think the answer is yes. I always knew, have always known, to the bounds of my memory, even when I was a child.

Participation in lecture and section is also your chance to bring up relevant issues you think are important. Student participation will be graded based on the following rubric:\n\n9-10 points: Student’s comments show that they have prepared the assigned material by clarifying and articulating the main ideas and arguments expressed in the material and comparing them when relevant. Student’s comments and questions are frequent and often affect the direction of the discussion.\n\n7-8: Student’s comments show that they have engaged with the assigned material. Student’s comments and questions are occasional and sometimes affect the direction of the class discussion.\n\n5-6: Student’s comments and questions sometimes show that they have completed some of the assigned reading. Student’s comments are infrequent and rarely affect the direction of the class discussion.\n\n3-4: Student attends section regularly but does not participate in the discussion.\n\n1-2: Student misses more than two class meetings (see section on Absences) or actively obstructs class discussion.	1	{"length": 1397, "index": 1}

In Week 3, students in Group A of each section will submit a 250-300-word response paragraph to the relevant discussion topic on Canvas by 8pm two nights before their section meeting.  These response paragraphs should start with a representative or striking quote from the readings and comment on the quote in relation to other reading and lecture material from that week.  We will spend some time workshopping this assignment during lecture in Week 2.  By 8pm the night before their section meeting, students in Group B should write one-two sentence reactions to at least two of their peers’ entries from the previous day.  Weekly due dates for this assignment will vary depending on when sections are scheduled.  Students should read the blog entries and responses before attending their discussion section with Mustafa or Yuanhao. This rhythm will repeat for weeks 3-10, so each group will compose 4 blog entries and respond to peers’ entries 4 times.  Each blog entry and response will be worth 5 points.\n\nIn-Class Midterm Exam (20%): The exam will include a map section, short IDs of people, places and events discussed in lecture, and short essays.  All students must complete the exam in class and contact the teaching team at least 48 hours in advance if conflicts or issues arise.\n\nFinal Project (35%): This assignment will differ depending on how many credits you are taking the course for.\n\nFor three credits, the assignment will be a 1000-1500-word book/film review OR an op-ed reflecting on a recent event in historical perspective. For exemplary book reviews in the field of Middle East history, you are encouraged to consider the reviews sections of the International Journal of Middle East Studies. The course materials contain a number of historically-focused op-eds that you can use as models for your own assignment, especially in Week 10.	2	{"length": 2033, "index": 2}

Alternatively, you may write a biographical essay of a person whose life has been shaped by historical forces in the modern Middle East – this person can be fictional or historical but the essay should reference historical events. The biographical chapters in the recommended book Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East (available online through Stanford libraries) may provide some ideas. Regardless of which you choose, your essay should be between 2500-3000 words, and should include a clear historical argument about how your person or place has changed and which events, personalities, and contextual dynamics have been most important to its trajectory.\n\nFor either credit option, you should communicate your topic to the teaching team by the end of Week 6 (Friday Feb. 17 at midnight) in a 2-3 sentence summary.  By the end of Week 8 (Friday Feb. 28 at midnight) you should submit a list of the sources you plan to use to craft your final project (either for 3 or 5 credits) to your TA.  These communications are worth 5% each, for a total of 10% of your final grade.  Those completing a three-credit essay should include at least 2 scholarly sources you plan to use to craft your final assignment, while those submitting a 5-credit project should include at least 4 sources.  You can include materials reviewed in class in your final project sources, but everyone should include at least 2 sources not reviewed in class. If you are unsure or would like to discuss your topic and appropriate sources, we can either communicate by email or you can schedule an appointment during office hours. A grading rubric for written assignments will be provided on Canvas.  For assistance with descriptive and argumentative writing, you are encouraged to consult the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking: hume.stanford.edu.	3	{"length": 2115, "index": 3}
b8ded39f-f0eb-4bb7-bb23-b771f26301a0	0aa75ce3-6c35-48b9-a0b1-ecc784a007af	approaching a crosswalk, I see a group of girls walking in my direction. My chest tightens with anxiety. They are a swirl of pretty and blonde and dark and their short skirts swish in the cold nighttime air which caresses with searching fingers the warmth of all exposed skin. I empty my eyes. I can tell from the periphery of my vision that they are giggling, all of them giggling, a protective charm against tall dark men like me whose faces have no expression and who articulate from the open sewer drains and unmanaged refuse which litters the street.\n\nNear the park, the road slants upwards. I have been sitting since morning, so I can feel the joints in my hip groan as I begin to step over the sleeping figure spanning the sidewalk. He mumbles something in his sleep. It is a fact that people mumble in their sleep. My older brother did not mumble, so until about six months ago, I did not know the truth of it. She had a lot to say. My foot is still moving, almost in slow motion, over this spokesperson, this itinerant of the conscious and unconscious worlds.\n\nAcross the street a man is yelling. His arms are twitching, and I cannot make out his face. “Fuck you fuck I didn’t know slithering it come dog my god fuck shit it’s wow didn’t how know so soon why” he is saying. I am grateful my eyes are already empty and unfocused, uncompromisingly and undeniably absent from any sphere of interpersonality.\n\nBut then, just as my right foot touches the ground, the muscles below my waist freeze. I pause, unmoving. Beneath me, in between my legs, is a man mumbling under his breath. I consider now that we have become a mathematical equation, a Greek lambda stretched over a symbol of division.\n\nThe streetlamp directly above my head switches on. Around us the entire alleyway is unlit, the entire block, but beneath this lonely spotlight we two are bathed in a dome of illumination. Beyond the swirling blizzard of dust and powder exposed by the focused beam in the darkness, the streets around us fade to an invisible opacity. The screaming goes silent; we two are alone.\n\nThe muscles of my neck creak as they guide my head downwards. The man beneath me has been dressed in a pristine brown overcoat and stained corduroy pants. He has mismatched socks, both purple, and heavy boots with a thick sole. He is sleeping on a piece of cardboard with eyes wide open. He mumbles in his sleep.\n\nWhen I was nine years old I had a little white dog named Cookie. After a long walk I would set him next to me, pressed on the outside of my left leg, and open a book. I would feel his little belly swell and deflate against my thigh with each breath. In between turns of the page I would run my fingers through his white fur. When my parents would enter the house, a chaos of motion and sound, me and Cookie would continue there on the old, indented cushions of the couch. For a long time Cookie and I sat like that.\n\nI lean downwards, assuming a squatting position just out of contact with the man’s coat, my feet still stuck, motionless. His lips are moving relentlessly, the sound of escaping air magnetically attractive to my ear. I stretch my right palm out and set it against the cold pavement, transferring my weight from my legs to my arm. From there I slowly lower my body closer and closer to his mouth. My arm quivers, my elbow bends, my whole body shakes with exertion.\n\nJust before I meet his lips, I turn my head. I feel his breath, first as a vague intimation along my jawbone, then as a humid warmth which expands from my ear to the entirety of my right cheek. I listen to his words. I think about all the people, within this city and without, who are alone on this frigid summer night. I imagine being there with them, imagine the company I could provide. I start to swell, bigger and bigger, start to feel how much I am, how all-encompassing my presence is. The man’s eyes are yellower than his teeth but that is okay; I mumble too: “Everything is okay, now.”\n\nOn the bus sometimes a woman with frizzy hair and a meth-addled face twitches her way to the seat next to me. When the officer comes by to check our tickets he just shakes his head. There is a dome of light around us. I can hear your story.\n\nEventually, he finishes. I look back at him, and his lips settle to a final stillness, the edges curved slightly upwards, a homeostatic state of peace. As his eyes drift shut, I am overwhelmed with a sense of wholeness. The overhead streetlamp begins to dim, darker and darker, until the light goes out and the snowy, dusting deluge disappears into the ether from whence it was pulled. In one of the apartments above us, I can make out the gentle glow of string lights. Through an open window the sound of EDM plays, a thrumming, heavy beat laid over the creaking of a bed frame. The man across the street is still yelling, and I come unstuck, my foot completing the step.\n\nWhen I enter the park I look down at my watch and see that a long time has passed since I left my building. The	2	{"length": 5000, "index": 2}

There is a perceptual trick to the crisscrossing lines and branches, a sense of descending vision through the cracks. Stars grimace from underneath leaves falling towards the sky. I put in my earbuds and play our song.\n\nWhen she left me it did not feel bad, did not feel like anything at all. I knelt on the hardwood tiles by our bed, raised my head to the mattress, and forced my vision to fix onto the covers, absolutely unmoving, the way I imagine Zen monks can for days and days which unfold without end. After a time the blankets started to shift, started to pulse and breathe like ocean waves in the oncoming evening tide. And finally, I felt a tremendous fear, because anything was possible.\n\nAs I walk back from the park, I notice the glint of my watch as it projects a sharpened glare into the eyes of a sleeping figure on a nearby bench. I conceal my left hand in my pocket and continue walking. Before long I have returned to the alleyway, where across the street the man is still crying, yelling, releasing a low, long series of unintelligible phrases. “Four times he said five fuck she didn’t ooh that’s one more night four into fucker going” he streams.\n\nParked next to the sidewalk is an ambulance, and walking by I shield my eyes from the blinding reddish orange light it casts in all directions. The window above us shuts and the music muffles, then turns silent. There are paramedics’ voices and a body bag is zipped shut and I hide, melting into the silhouettes of the buildings. Before long, my shadow returns to my door.\n\nI stare down at my palms and see how much has passed. Inside my apartment the bed is made and I am unable to think of anything except how tired I am, deep in my stomach, like a skyscraper who suddenly finds three floors have gone missing from the middle, no choice but to fold in half. I collapse into my bed and reach my right arm out to the end of the covers, the rest of my body still. I wonder what stories I will tell tonight.	3	{"length": 2051, "index": 3}

This could be a map of places mentioned in a primary source relevant to your topic, a visualization of quantitative data important to your argument, a digital timeline that expresses your narrative of change over time, or another creation of your choosing. Depending on the amount of labor involved in data creation and visualization, your word-count requirement will be reduced for the written element of the project. Please schedule an appointment with Professor Barakat or your TA as early as possible to discuss ideas if you want to pursue this option. If you have no prior experience in the Digital Humanities but are curious, this is a very good opportunity to learn simple tools.\n\nCommunication: Email is the best way to get in touch with the teaching team, and we will try our best to respond to you within 24 hours. Likewise, you are responsible for checking your email and Canvas for course-related communication.\n\nOffice Hours:  Professor Barakat will hold office hours Thursday afternoons 12:30-2:30pm. You are encouraged to stop by even if you do not have specific questions, and to schedule individual meetings during Weeks 5 and 6 to discuss your final project ideas. You are also encouraged to email Prof Barakat at any point in the quarter for an appointment.\n\nCourse Policies:\n\nRecording and Visitors: In order to create a safe space in the classroom to think and learn with other students, there will be absolutely no recording of class sessions or posting the content of lectures or discussion sections on social media at any time. We expect everyone who comes into the class to act with respect and consideration to each other and the teaching team. Only students who are enrolled are permitted to attend class. Anyone who wishes to attend the class outside of enrollment must email the teaching team for permission.	4	{"length": 2008, "index": 4}

Attendance will be taken in both lectures and discussion sections.  If you will miss more than one discussion section meeting, you should communicate with your TA about the circumstances keeping you from attending.  If you fail to do so, your participation grade will decrease by one-third of a letter grade (A to A-, A- to B+, etc.) for each missed session. Likewise, if you cannot complete a written assignment by the posted due date, you should communicate with your TA about an extension. If you fail to do so, your grade will decrease by one-third of a letter grade every 24 hours after the due date.\n\nAcademic Integrity: You are encouraged to discuss course material and assignments with your peers and workshop each other’s writing. Any work you submit for evaluation, however, must be the result of your own research, writing and/or data creation and must reflect your own approach to the topic. You must also be sure to properly cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, films, etc. that have helped you with your work in accordance with the Chicago Manual of Style. If you received any help with your writing (feedback on drafts, etc.), you must acknowledge this assistance. This includes using generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT): students must acknowledge the use of such tools, describe their use and default to disclosing such assistance when in doubt.  All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code.\n\nStudents with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE).

Let's call\nthese two types of students "CS" and "non-CS", and assume that during each week a student changes\ntheir type at most once (and may change again in subsequent weeks). Let p<sub>n</sub> = <x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>> be the 2-vector\nwhose entries x<sub>n</sub> and y<sub>n</sub> are the proportions of such students of type non-CS and CS respectively at\nthe end of the nth week (so x<sub>n</sub> + y<sub>n</sub> = 1 always).\n(a) (3 points) Among those of type CS at the start of each week suppose 90% remain that way at\nthe end of the week but 10% switch to non-CS.

then her hazel brown eyes would light up with the same warmth of the hearth flame that illuminated her face, and she’d make her way over to the sofa where I was, snuggle up against my shoulder, make the words on the page come to life, and I would be filled.\nIt was my facial expressions, my hand gestures, the slightest glances to the left and to the right, she understood all of it, it took no effort on her part and was so extraordinary that she very well may have been reading not the story in the book, but rather the inscriptions of my soul.\nYou told me yourself that even you couldn’t come close to comprehending me in that way.\nBut then she’d be turning the pages, and I’d remember that every good story has an end, that her gift was a crutch I would one day have to set to the side so I could stand on my own two feet, and I’d feel empty again.\nIt has been a long time since I have heard you tell us anything.\nWhen we were ten, you had to go back to China.\nWàipó fell ill with [fill in specific] and needed your care.\nI also remember how hard it was for you when you lost your job in the states.\nThe one you found near Wàipó’s home was so much better than anything you could find here.\nI know it was a long and difficult decision, but eventually you found a caretaker to look after us and left the country.\nI’m sure anyone would’ve done the same if they were in your position.\nBesides, it let you be closer to Bàba.\nI don’t know much about him since he died when I was three, but I know you missed him very much.\nIt must be hard, taking care of Wàipó while providing for two children on the other side of the globe without his help.\nWhen money was running tight, Faith called you and said we didn’t need a caretaker anymore.\nShe said that she could take care of me, and that she could take care of herself.\nI know I can’t call you, Māma, but I should have texted you more than I did.\nSo I’m sorry.\nIt was the day you left, that at some point it was just you and me alone in the living room while Faith was in the bedroom doing a last check of the bags to make sure everything was ready for your long journey across the Pacific.\nDon’t get into trouble, don’t forget to text me.\nAnd take care of your sister, you told me.\nYou know I’ve always had good ears, and I could tell your words were slightly more hollow on the third instruction.\nIt was an unspoken and shared assumption that it was always going to very much be the other way around; I hated it nonetheless.\nBut it was after that, the last thing you told me before you left, that made quite the profound impression on me.\nWǒ ér zi, you told me, with a voice I have not heard so somber since the Saturday you picked out white chrysanthemums for Bàba’s funeral.\nWith li	0	{"length": 5016, "index": 0}

you were proud of her for that.\nI’d knock on her door after I finished eating, and then we would walk to school together.\nYou said to us to always walk to and from school together and at that point I didn’t really know why, but for the longest time we did.\nLast winter when I was bedridden with the flu, Faith stayed home and took care of me until I could leave the house again.\nWhenever the vocal teacher held her up for an extra half hour after school, I always waited.\nThat was our thing, to and fro through winter mornings and summer afternoons.\nI preferred hot weather and Faith preferred cold weather, like you.\nIt let her wear her favorite oversized hoodie.\nWe went to a small high school, about a fifteen minute walk from our home.\nNot much has changed in our sparse suburban town, so we were aware of most of the people at our school from the many years spent together in grade school and middle school.\nA few of us never matured, like the boys in the black bandanas, but the rest of us slowly transformed, as the sands of time weathered us like stones in the storm of a harsh desert, the grip of reality threatening to pry away the magic of our childhood.\nIt was jarring to me to see how the fastest runner in our grade so abruptly lost his hubris after a knee injury that forced him to drop athletics, or how the smartest girl in my math class struggled to pass her exams after her father lost his job, as she had to spend her studying hours searching for paid work.\nBut they were all strong individuals, and they adapted to their surroundings as they shifted with the seasons.\nThe boy found a new interest in our school’s associated student body, and now he is class president.\nThe girl has a waitlist of precalculus students pursuing her tutoring, offering rates I didn’t previously think were possible for this kind of job.\nI wonder if this is what the gods saw, when they witnessed with their own eyes the evolution of species.\n[Work in Progress]\n*\n*\n*\nOn the morning of my seventeenth birthday, I woke up with an idea.\nIt took place on a Sunday.\nThat morning Faith took me to Zheng’s, a local bakery that had opened up a few blocks away a couple of years after you left.\nI knew you had always hoped that our town would eventually have a new Chinese bakery after the old one closed down.\nYou told me that when we were really young, Faith loved red bean bread and hated egg tarts, and that I loved egg tarts and hated red bean bread, and I can tell you that we still do.\nWe always came here each year for whatever few special occasions we celebrated.\nI usually like chocolate cakes, but that day I instead pointed at one of the last strawberry cakes behind the glass, so Faith went up to the cashier and ordered it for me.\nThat strawberry cake please.\nIt’s for my brother’s birthday!\nOh, happy birthday to him then!\nHe handed Faith the receipt.\nThank you for coming.\nHave a nice day!\nAs we were leaving the store I thought about how he managed to say all of this without even looking at me.\nWhen we got home I went to the bookshelf by the fireplace and picked out one of the older books, the one with the Chinese folktales that you read to us when we were five.\nThere was a story in there that I wanted to hear again, so I opened to the right page and motioned to Faith to come sit next to me on the sofa.\nAnd so she read.\nShe read about how the hero archer Hòu Yì had shot down nine of the ten suns to save the Earth from being scorched, and how the goddess Xīwángmǔ had rewarded him with an elixir of immortality.\nHow he didn’t want to drink the potion so he gave it to his wife, Cháng’é, to protect.\nHow one of his apprentices tried to steal the elixir, and how Cháng’é drank it to stop him from taking it.\n“After she drank the potion, she rose up to the moon.\nWhen Hòu Yì found out what had happened, he was so sad he left fruits and cakes she liked in the yard every year.\nThe Chinese people sympathized with the hero and made offerings to Cháng’é also.\nThat’s why we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.”\nI tilted my head and pointed at the sky.\nDo you think she can see us celebrating?\nFrom all the wa	1	{"length": 5010, "index": 1}

I’m sure she’s happy about everything we’re doing for her.”\nBut we can’t see her.\nHow do we know if she’s even there?\n“She’s there. The story says she’s immortal, remember?”\nDo you think it gets lonely up there?\nWhat if she wanted to tell us something?\n“She would find a way. I think she’d send us a sign or something.”\nI wanted to ask But what if she can’t but I just glanced out the window instead.\nI saw a little white crescent.\nThere was either someone there looking at us that I couldn’t see, or no one there at all, but I couldn’t tell.\nI turned off the lights in the kitchen and Faith lit up seventeen candles for the cake.\nShe wrapped her arms, covered by the sleeves of her oversized hoodie, around me.\n“Happy Birthday. Look at what I got you!”\nShe held up to me a beautiful ballpoint pen.\nThe nose cone was a lustrous golden and the barrel jet black.\nIt felt smooth in my hand, and moving its tip across the page gives satisfaction to my fingers.\nIt’s easy to describe, because it’s the same pen with which I am writing to you.\nI saw Faith smile at me from across the kitchen counter.\nFaith always says I don’t smile very much and I should smile more, that she loves my smile.\nSo I smiled back, but not just for her.\nI smiled because sitting across from me was someone whose offering I held in my hand and she could see me and I could see her, and that was enough.\nI saved this memory in my mind as one does money in a bank for retirement.\nI saved it, for these highs of happiness are too rare and end too quickly and I know later I will be shrouded in a cloud of darkness and need something to grasp onto, anything to drag me out.\nDo you know about the cloud, Māma?\nEveryone else in this world seems able to run like machines off these little highs and I don’t know how they do it and every time I can’t do anything about it the cloud just comes back, it reminds me that happiness is just a distraction from how much the world really sucks, it slows the turning of my gears until all I want to do is curl up under the covers and sleep.\nIt’s hard to reach into my mind and withdraw the memories I’ve saved, because now they have turned against me.\nThey stab me in the back.\nBut who is to blame but me.\nAs I blew out the candles, I made my wish.\nI made a wish to be heard.\nThat’s why I requested Faith to perform with me at the school talent show next month.\n[Work in Progress]\n*\n*\n*\nIn the coming weeks I picked up that pen and put it to good use.\nI spent night after night at our piano, trying chords and forming lines, and slowly it came together.\nI wanted to write about the true, the good, and the beautiful, just the way everyone would like it.\nSo I wrote about Cháng’é, and about how the moon was her cell of solitary confinement.\nI wrote about how lonely it was for her to look everyday outside her cell, but for no one else to be able to look back in.\nThen, just when she’s about to go insane from solitude, he appears - her beloved Hòu Yì comes to the moon, and they live happily ever after.\nOf course that didn’t happen and it’s naive, thinking about it now, but at the time the song made sense in my head.\nThe day of the talent show started the same as all the others.\nFaith called you and I ate a bagel and we walked to school together.\nI went to math then I went to English and when the lunch bell rang the other students pushed past me in the hallway like I was one of the cubes in a foam pit.\nLike every other day I ate lunch with Faith and Faith only and of course the black bandana boys came over and mocked us but I ignored them because of what they didn’t know.\nThey didn’t know that I didn’t have a care in the world for what they said, because today was my festival and soon I would be at the top of this Earth with all eyes on me as Faith says out loud the first words I never had.\nI dreamed in plain daylight about the future those words would give me, Māma.\nI spent the rest of the afternoon anticipating that stage.\nI saw the piano, illuminated by the lights that promised to make visible the invisible ink that coated my skin.\nI saw the microphone, from which I could already hear Faith singing my song.\nI saw the audience of a thousand awestruck faces and though it’s a little blurry, if I tried hard enough I could see you, sitting front and center, looking at me with the same pride that previously only my sister could give you.\nI think you would know how I felt.\nThe visions ran like a drug through my mind as I imagine they once did yours.\n[Work In Progress]\n*\n*\n*\nSorry.\nI etch that final word onto the paper, before signing off.\nI love you.\nThen, after a moment of extra thought.\nPlease forgive me.\nI graze down all the pages one last time before I fold and tuck them into a white envelope.\nA tag that says Send to Mother goes on the flap of the envelope.\nThe envelope goes in a little box with the mooncake I bought from Zheng’s with leftover pocket change.\nThe box goes on the floor at the foot of Faith’s door.\nShe doesn’t open that door	2	{"length": 5010, "index": 2}

There is no one around and nothing\nin sight except the sand.. I, too, am naked, barefoot, dumbfounded\nby everything around me.. I can feel the sand under my feet and a\ncool wind.. I move slowly toward the bench.. When and why has she\ncome back after all these years?. Her long black hair is piled about\nher head.. A few locks cover her right cheek, as if guarding her face,\nwhich has not changed with the years.. Her eyebrows are carefully\nplucked, and her eyelids, which end in thick eyelashes, are shut.\nHer nose guards her lips, which bear pink lipstick as if she were still\nalive.. Her nipples are erect; there is no trace of the surgery.. Her\nhands are clasped over her navel; her fingernails and toenails are\npainted the same pink as her lipstick.. Her pubic hair is shaved.\nI wonder whether she is asleep or dead.. I am afraid to touch her.. I\nlook into her face and whisper her name, “Reem.” She smiles, her\neyes still shut at first.. Then she opens them, and the blackness in her\npupils smiles as well.. I can't grasp what is going on.. I ask in a loud\nvoice, “Reem, what are you doing here?"\nI am about to hug and kiss her, but she warns me: “Don't kiss me.\nWash me first so we can be together and then .. .. .. ”\n"What?. You are still alive?"\n“Wash me so we can be together.. I missed you so much.”\n“But you are not dead!"\n“Wash me, darling .. .. .. Wash me so we can be together.”\n“With what?. There is nothing here."\n"Wash me, darling." Raindrops begin to fall, and she closes her eyes.. I wipe a drop off\nher nose with my index finger.. Her skin is warm, which means she is\nalive.. I start to caress her hair.. I will wash her with the rain, I think.\nShe smiles as if she'd heard my thought.. Another drop settles above\nher left eyebrow.. I wipe it off.\nI think I hear a car approaching.. I turn around and see a Humvee\ndriving at an insane speed, leaving a trail of flying dust.. It suddenly\nswerves to the right and comes to a stop a few meters away from us.. Its\ndoors open.. Masked men wearing khaki uniforms and carrying ma-\nchine guns rush toward us.. I try to shield Reem with my right hand,\nbut one of the men has already reached me.. He hits me in the face\nwith the stock of his machine gun.. I fall to the ground.. He kicks me in\nthe stomach..

Two men force me to get down on my knees\nand tie my wrists with a wire behind my back.. One of them puts a\nknife to my neck; the other blindfolds me.. I try to run away, but they\nhold me tightly.. I scream again, but cannot hear my screams.. I hear\nonly Reem's shrieks, the laughter and grunts of the men, the sound of\nthe rain.\nI feel a sharp pain, then the cold blade of the knife penetrating\nmy neck.. Hot blood spills over my chest and back.. My head falls to\nthe ground and rolls like a ball on the sand.. I hear footsteps.. One of\nthe men takes off my blindfold and shoves it into his pocket.. He spits\nin my face and goes away.. I see my body to the left of the bench,\nkneeling in a puddle of blood.\nThe other men return to the Humvee, two of them dragging\nReem by her arms.. She tries to turn her head back in my direction,\nbut one of them slaps her.. I cry out her name but can't hear my\nvoice.. They put her in the back seat and shut the door.. The engine\nstarts.. The Humvee speeds away and disappears over the horizon.\nThe rain keeps falling on the empty bench.\nI woke up panting and sweating.. I wiped my forehead and face.. The\nsame nightmare had been recurring for weeks, with minor changes.. Sometimes I saw Reem's severed head on the bench and heard her\nvoice saying, "Wash me, darling,” but this was the first time there\nwas rain.. It must have slipped into my dream from outdoors.. I could\nhear drops on the window next to my bed.\nI looked at my watch.. It was already 3:30 A.M.\nI've slept only three hours after a long and grueling day..

Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price – the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk.\n\nBonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds.	0	{"length": 2445, "index": 0}

In other words, investors believe that there is no chance that the U.S. government will default on interest and principal payments on the bonds it issues. For the remainder of this article, we will use U.S. Treasury bonds in our examples, thereby eliminating credit risk from the discussion.\n\nCalculating a Bond's Yield and Price To understand how interest rates affect a bond's price, you must understand the concept of yield. While there are several different types of yield calculations, for the purposes of this article, we will use the yield to maturity (YTM) calculation. A bond's YTM is simply the discount rate that can be used to make the present value of all of a bond's cash flows equal to its price.\n\nIn other words, a bond's price is the sum of the present value of each cash flow, wherein the present value of each cash flow is calculated using the same discount factor. This discount factor is the yield. When a bond's yield rises, by definition, its price falls, and when a bond's yield falls, by definition, its price increases.\n\nA Bond's Relative Yield The maturity or term of a bond largely affects its yield. To understand this statement, you must understand what is known as the yield curve. The yield curve represents the YTM of a class of bonds (in this case, U.S. Treasury bonds).\n\nIn most interest rate environments, the longer the term to maturity, the higher the yield will be. This makes intuitive sense because the longer the period of time before cash flow is received, the greater the chance is that the required discount rate (or yield) will move higher.\n\nInflation Expectations Determine the Investor's Yield Requirements Inflation is a bond's worst enemy. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a bond's future cash flows. Typically, bonds are fixed-rate investments. If inflation is increasing (or rising prices), the return on a bond is reduced in real terms, meaning adjusted for inflation. For example, if a bond pays a 4% yield and inflation is 3%, the bond's real rate of return is 1%.\n\nIn other words, the higher the current rate of inflation and the higher the (expected) future rates of inflation, the higher the yields will rise across the yield curve, as investors will demand a higher yield to compensate for inflation risk.	1	{"length": 2339, "index": 1}
afcae36e-fb95-423e-81e2-72dec5cb16f2	03db4281-0ccf-4ad7-9b54-a17698e28b7a	Note that Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) can be an effective way to offset inflation risk while providing a real rate of return guaranteed by the U.S. government. As a result, TIPS can be used to help battle inflation within an investment portfolio.\n\nShort-Term, Long-Term Interest Rates, and Inflation Expectations Inflation and expectations of future inflation are a function of the dynamics between short-term and long-term interest rates. Worldwide, short-term interest rates are administered by nations' central banks. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets the federal funds rate. Historically, other dollar-denominated short-term interest rates, such as LIBOR or LIBID, have been highly correlated with the fed funds rate.\n\nThe FOMC administers the fed funds rate to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting economic growth while maintaining price stability. This is not an easy task for the FOMC; there is always debate about the appropriate fed funds level, and the market forms its own opinions on how well the FOMC is doing.\n\nCentral banks do not control long-term interest rates. Market forces (supply and demand) determine equilibrium pricing for long-term bonds, which set long-term interest rates. If the bond market believes that the FOMC has set the fed funds rate too low, expectations of future inflation increase, which means long-term interest rates increase relative to short-term interest rates – the yield curve steepens.\n\nIf the market believes that the FOMC has set the fed funds rate too high, the opposite happens, and long-term interest rates decrease relative to short-term interest rates – the yield curve flattens.\n\nThe Timing of a Bond's Cash Flows and Interest Rates The timing of a bond's cash flows is important. This includes the bond's term to maturity. If market participants believe that there is higher inflation on the horizon, interest rates and bond yields will rise (and prices will decrease) to compensate for the loss of the purchasing power of future cash flows. Bonds with the longest cash flows will see their yields rise and prices fall the most.	2	{"length": 2157, "index": 2}

The bond market has a measure of price change relative to interest rate changes; this important bond metric is known as duration.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Nominal Rates and Real Rates?\n\nNominal interest rates are the stated rates, while real rates adjust for inflation. Real rates provide a more accurate picture of borrowing costs and investment returns by accounting for the erosion of purchasing power. 10\n\nWhy Do Bond Prices and Interest Rates Have an Inverse Relationship? Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, newly issued bonds offer higher yields, making existing lower-yielding bonds less attractive, which decreases their prices.\n\nWhy Is the Yield Curve Important? The yield curve illustrates the relationship between bond yields and their maturities. A normal curve slopes upward, indicating higher yields for longer maturities. Inverted or flat curves can signal economic uncertainty or impending recession. This curve helps shape communicate future expectations about global economies.\n\nHow Can Investors Safeguard Their Portfolios Against Interest Rate and Inflation Fluctuations? Investors can diversify their portfolios to include assets like stocks, commodities, and inflation-protected securities to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes and inflation on their investments. If you're specifically interested in hedging your investment portfolio against high or increasing interest rates, consider discussing this investment decision with your financial advisor.\n\nThe Bottom Line Interest rates, bond yields (prices), and inflation expectations correlate with one another. Movements in short-term interest rates, as dictated by a nation's central bank, will affect different bonds with different terms to maturity differently, depending on the market's expectations of future levels of inflation.\n\nThe key to understanding how a change in interest rates will affect a certain bond's price and yield is to recognize where on the yield curve that bond lies (the short end or the long end) and to understand the dynamics between short- and long-term interest rates. With this knowledge, you can use different measures of duration and convexity to become a seasoned bond market investor.	3	{"length": 2490, "index": 3}

This occurs most densely in Lolita’s Foreword, which is a collage of possible readerly postures. Caught in Nabokov’s web, it is easy to forget that many of those postures, such as the desire for social workers and educators to be more vigilant protectors of children, are reasonable and easy to accept. But it is John Ray Jr’s prosaicness, his banal moral position, which dissolves in contact with Lolita. As proof of that moral dissolution, to John, Lolita is a “tempest in a test tube,” a demonstration of an act more than 12% of adult American males “enjoy yearly,” and whose author, had he come in contact with a competent psychopathologist, would have caused no disaster. So we understand early that this John’s position is absurd; we even see it quickly compromised when he suffices to say that Humbert is “abnormal” and “not a gentleman” before praising “how majestically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author.” With this front-loaded guide on how to not read the book—to merely abhor the author while delighting in his gorgeous aesthetics—Nabokov does not simply separate aesthetics from morality, nor does he only problematize aesthetics as something potentially obfuscatory towards proper morals. Instead, he is laying the groundwork for a morality that does not contain aesthetics, but is re and co-defined by its two-way relationship with aesthetics. This we see most clearly stated on page 283 of Lolita, when Humbert says:\n\n“Unless it can be proven to me… that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. To quote an old poet: ‘The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.’”	0	{"length": 2309, "index": 0}

Nabokov jokes, via his narrator, that Pnin’s sensation of sliding back to his own childhood is what a veteran psychoanalyst might explain as re-experiencing one’s baptism.. But what we are shown as the “explosion of intervening recollection” seems to be nothing less than an alternate explanation to the ridiculous psychoanalytic one of Pnin’s stroke, or panic attacks—that is, the origin of Pnin’s anxiety, which manifests throughout the novel.. We are told at the beginning of Pnin’s recollection that everything started with a strange chill that pervaded his body, but it’s unclear if this an actual fever chill, since his mother, who is described as a frail, nervous little person, simply looks at his temperature with stupefaction.. She calls the doctor, but only after the doctor leaves—in fact, “no sooner had the doctor left” than she and a servant girl wrap poor Timofey in soaked linen, absorbent cotton, and sticky, diabolical oilcloth, the hue of urine and fever.. Indeed, we’re told that these were of no avail against the branching chill of his ribs.. If we envision a scenario in which sad, studying Pnin has been victimized by his mother’s anxiety of chills by being wrapped in this horrible cocoon, then the subsequent scene of aesthetic birth, in which he tries to find the key to the pattern of life in the flowers he is restricted to stare at takes on significance not as idiosyncratic fever but very real trauma.. The anxious association and strength of this trauma is only magnified on page 24, when it is the “sense of being late for some appointment as odiously exact as school, dinner, or bedtime” which “added the discomfort of awkward haste to the difficulties of a quest that was grading into delirium.” It is then, in this seemingly unbearable moment, that the foliage of the flowers detaches, loses its flatness, and dissolves into a form of aesthetic bliss.. And thus adult Pnin, in the park having a panic attack about missing his presentation, at every turn being thwarted by incorrect schedules and poorly placed papers, is thrust back to the source of the trauma which caused his anxiety, and his aesthetics, to germinate..	1	{"length": 2285, "index": 1}

Though the co-definition of morals and aesthetics in Lolita is not nearly so simple, that subtle act of reconstituting moral goodness appears also in the afterword, when Nabokov identifies the purpose of fiction to be aesthetic bliss, which allows connection with other states of artistic being, where curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy are nurtured. But if this gives us some vague, somewhat unstable picture of how morals might be defined as a compassionate dilution of aesthetic objectification, how do we reverse the definition — in Nabokov’s world, what defines aesthetics, and do they have a metaphysics?\n\nRichard Rorty takes direct issue with Nabokov’s aesthetics. He argues that Nabokov insightfully, if not originally, identifies psychological associations and personal history as the origin of our moral and aesthetic behavior. He sees these Freudian idiosyncratic origins as temporal and individual, and therefore not the grounds for the higher bliss Nabokov maintains as vital to fiction. But this supposed temporality, I think, is what Nabokov cleverly erodes in Pnin, allowing him to trace aesthetics in a more complex and transcendent manner.\n\nVia this superficially silly story one is reminded of Marcel Proust, of that legendary author’s debilitating and surely terrifying bouts of severe asthma, and of his at least partially autobiographical childhood character in the first volume of In Search of Lost Time. In that volume, Marcel’s overwhelming and inescapable nervous pathology leads him to cloister himself in his room, waiting for a good night kiss from his mother and, in his anxious isolation and general inability to play outside, weaving fantastic stories from the lamplight on the wall. Proust’s father was a neurologist who specialized in nervous disorders and believed Proust to have a mental abnormality of neurasthenia rather than his severe, breath-stealing asthma; thus we have the picture of two characters, little Marcel and poor Pnin, who, traumatized by an incomprehensible system which smashed against the restrictive moral and medical allowances of their childhood, birthed an aesthetic sense which punctures subsequent time.	3	{"length": 2271, "index": 3}

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"	0	{"length": 2434, "index": 0}

Behind him, his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.	1	{"length": 1159, "index": 1}

There is no one around and nothing\nin sight except the sand. I, too, am naked, barefoot, dumbfounded\nby everything around me. I can feel the sand under my feet and a\ncool wind. I move slowly toward the bench. When and why has she\ncome back after all these years? Her long black hair is piled about\nher head. A few locks cover her right cheek, as if guarding her face,\nwhich has not changed with the years. Her eyebrows are carefully\nplucked, and her eyelids, which end in thick eyelashes, are shut.\nHer nose guards her lips, which bear pink lipstick as if she were still\nalive. Her nipples are erect; there is no trace of the surgery. Her\nhands are clasped over her navel; her fingernails and toenails are\npainted the same pink as her lipstick. Her pubic hair is shaved.\nI wonder whether she is asleep or dead. I am afraid to touch her. I\nlook into her face and whisper her name, “Reem.” She smiles, her\neyes still shut at first. Then she opens them, and the blackness in her\npupils smiles as well. I can't grasp what is going on. I ask in a loud\nvoice, “Reem, what are you doing here?"\nI am about to hug and kiss her, but she warns me: “Don't kiss me.\nWash me first so we can be together and then . . . ”\n"What? You are still alive?"\n“Wash me so we can be together. I missed you so much.”\n“But you are not dead!"\n“Wash me, darling . . . Wash me so we can be together.”\n“With what? There is nothing here."\n"Wash me, darling." Raindrops begin to fall, and she closes her eyes. I wipe a drop off\nher nose with my index finger. Her skin is warm, which means she is\nalive. I start to caress her hair. I will wash her with the rain, I think.\nShe smiles as if she'd heard my thought. Another drop settles above\nher left eyebrow. I wipe it off.	0	{"length": 1830, "index": 0}

It must have slipped into my dream from outdoors.. I could\nhear drops on the window next to my bed.\nI looked at my watch.. It was already 3:30 A.M.\nI've slept only three hours after a long and grueling day.. I am\nworn out.\nDeath is not content with what it takes from me in my waking\nhours, it insists on haunting me even in my sleep.. Isn't it enough\nthat I toil all day tending to its eternal guests, preparing them to\nsleep in its lap?. Is death punishing me because I thought I could\nescape its clutches?. If my father were still alive he would mock my\nsilly thoughts.. He would dismiss all this as infantile, unbecoming to\na man.. Didn't he spend a lifetime doing his job day after day, never\nonce complaining of death?. But death back then was timid and\nmore measured than today.\nI can almost hear death saying: “I am what I am and haven't\nchanged at all.. I am but a postman.”\nIf death is a postman, then I receive his letters every day.. I am the\none who opens carefully the bloodied and torn envelopes.. I am the\none who washes them, who removes the stamps of death and dries\nand perfumes them, mumbling what I don't entirely believe in.\nThen I wrap them carefully in white so they may reach their final\nreader-the grave.\nBut letters are piling up, Father!. Tenfold more than what you used\nto see in the span of a week now pass before me in a day or two.. If you\nwere alive, Father, would you say that that is fate and God's will?. I\nwish you were here so I could leave Mother with you and escape\nwithout feeling guilty.. You were heavily armed with faith, and that\nmade your heart a castle.. My heart, by contrast, is an abandoned\nhouse whose windows are shattered and doors unhinged.. Ghosts\nplay inside it, and the winds wail.\nAs a child, I would cover my head with a second pillow to block\nout noise.. I look for it now; it has fallen by the bed next to my\nslippers.. I pick it up and bury my head under it in order to reclaim my share of the night.. The image of Reem being dragged away by\nher hair keeps returning.\nReem hadn't been at the heart of my nightmare until a few weeks\nago.. Where was she now?. I heard a few years ago that she was in\nAmsterdam.. I'll Google her again tomorrow when I go to the Inter-\nnet café after work.. I'll try a different spelling of her name in English\nand maybe I'll find something..	1	{"length": 2477, "index": 1}

I finished it in a cafe, right about the same time I finished my coffee and my cherry cake. The cafe is in a beach town in Japan, where I have been for a very long time. Soon enough I’ll go home.\n\nWhen I say I have been here for a very long time, I mean that. I’ve been here for six months, which doesn’t sound very long until you remember that I’m twenty years old and that when you’re twenty years old six months can be a lifetime. A lot can change in six months. You can do a lot. You can get sick. You can get better. You can buy umbrellas. You can lose them. You can make friends. You can lose them. You can fall in love, and you can lose the love. You can find yourself. You can lose that, too.\n\nThere was a girl I met here, and after every date we would go for a walk. We went on a lot of walks together, just the two of us. I think it was five walks but each walk was very long and because they were the longest walks I had ever been on, just the two of us, we walked very far and covered a lot of distance. At least I did. I don’t think she moved very much if I’m being perfectly honest, but that’s okay. I moved enough for the both of us.\n\nWhen you think about it five walks is not a lot of walks. And at the end of the fifth walk it became very clear to me that the last one hadn’t been a real walk but a fake one, that like a lot of final moments it only meant something as an echo of previous moments and couldn’t stand up on its own.\n\nIt would be okay except I have a problem. I dream about her quite often. I’ll be falling asleep on the train and suddenly I’ll be dreaming about her. Or I’ll wake up early in the morning with barely enough energy to drag myself on that miserable walk to work, and I’ll realize I spent the whole night dreaming about her.\n\nI’m not sure what to do about it to be honest because I realized quite a long time ago that it wasn’t going to happen and I was sad for a while and then I was less sad for a while and then I suppose I was back to normal. So no matter how much I think about it, I can’t seem to figure out why I dream about her so often, or what to do.\n\nWe don’t even have sex in the dreams, either. That would be normal I think. In the dreams we just sit next to each other and talk, or walk and talk, or go to some building and talk. We don’t talk about much. I think I might be in love with her, or at least some part of me wants me to think I am, which is especially odd be	0	{"length": 2498, "index": 0}

They are a swirl of pretty and blonde and dark and their short skirts swish in the cold nighttime air which caresses with searching fingers the warmth of all exposed skin. I empty my eyes. I can tell from the periphery of my vision that they are giggling, all of them giggling, a protective charm against tall dark men like me whose faces have no expression and who articulate from the open sewer drains and unmanaged refuse which litters the street. Near the park, the road slants upwards. I have been sitting since morning, so I can feel the joints in my hip groan as I begin to step over the sleeping figure spanning the sidewalk. He mumbles something in his sleep. It is a fact that people mumble in their sleep. My older brother did not mumble, so until about six months ago, I did not know the truth of it. She had a lot to say. My foot is still moving, almost in slow motion, over this spokesperson, this itinerant of the conscious and unconscious worlds. Across the street a man is yelling. His arms are twitching, and I cannot make out his face. "Fuck you fuck I didn't know slithering it come dog my god fuck shit it's wow didn't how know so soon why" he is saying. I am grateful my eyes are already empty and unfocused, uncompromisingly and undeniably absent from any sphere of interpersonality. But then, just as my right foot touches the ground, the muscles below my waist freeze. I pause, unmoving. Beneath me, in between my legs, is a man mumbling under his breath. I consider now that we have become a mathematical equation, a Greek lambda stretched over a symbol of division. The streetlamp directly above my head switches on. Around us the entire alleyway is unlit, the entire block, but beneath this lonely spotlight we two are bathed in a dome of illumination. Beyond the swirling blizzard of dust and powder exposed by the focused beam in the darkness, the streets around us fade to an invisible opacity. The screaming goes silent; we two are alone. The muscles of my neck creak as they guide my head downwards. The man beneath me has been dressed in a pristine brown overcoat and stained corduroy pants. He has mismatched socks, both purple, and heavy boots with a thick sole. He is sleeping on a piece of cardboard with eyes wide open. He mumbles in his sleep. When I was nine years old I had a little white dog named Cookie. After a long walk I would set him next to me	4	{"length": 2498, "index": 4}

She tries to turn her head back in my direction,\nbut one of them slaps her. I cry out her name but can't hear my\nvoice. They put her in the back seat and shut the door. The engine\nstarts. The Humvee speeds away and disappears over the horizon.\nThe rain keeps falling on the empty bench.\n\nI woke up panting and sweating. I wiped my forehead and face.

(Not a single router, or chromecast) Say two flows share 10 Mbits/s. Then, it could possibly be:\n- 5 Mbit/s + 5 Mbit/s\n- 2.5 Mbit/s + 7.5 Mbit/s\n- 0 Mbit/s + 10 Mbit/s\n- 0 Mbit/s + 5 Mbit/s (this is a collapse)\n- 0 Mbit/s + 10 Mbit/s but every packet is sent twice (throughput 10 Mbit/s but “goodput” 5 Mbit/s, this is also a collapse)\n- Easiest approach of flow-control: window_size.\n- We could have both: 1) receiver’s window and 2) “congestion window”. The minimum of the two cap the actual window.\n- “Self-clocking”: a new byte is sent only after a byte is acked (or judged lost)\n- Wrong window size is okay (see below), but wrong rate would lead to more dangerous situations (e.g. queue overflow).\n- How much data can be “on the link”?\n- The BDP (Bottleneck link rate Delay Product): RTT * link rate\n- The ideal value for window size for one flow\n- If the window size is greater than BDP, packets queue up at routers. (At the steady state, window size - BDP bytes is queued at the bottleneck, not so bad).\n- If the window size is smaller than BDP, the bottleneck link may be idle. (Some part of the link would be wasted, but still not so bad)\n- With one flow, BDP is the ideal window. Any window less than BDP + max queue size is “no loss” window.\n- Say two flows share 10 Mbits/s and RTT = 100ms.\n- One flow, good window ~ 10 Mbit/s * 100ms = 1 Mbit = 100 kByte\n- Two flow, good window: 50 kByte for each flow\n- BUT, the “ideal” window is unknown at runtime. How to approximate the right congestion window without knowing: RTT, bottleneck link rate, and number of flows\n\nOne important note is that:\n\n"... all routers support per-flow round robin (RR) queuing on the outgoing links and have sufficient buffer to never cause drops (packet loss)."\n\nThis may be helpful:\n\n"At the bottleneck router, buffer will begin to build up for each flow. However, once this becomes sufficiently large (W-BDP), the sender will send additional packets only on receiving ACKs, which will be received at the bottleneck throughput. Given this and that each router implements round-robin queueing, the worst off flow’s throughput will be maximized (since all flows at the bottleneck link get equal share of the link). Therefore, this system converges to max-min fairness."	3	{"length": 2346, "index": 3}

As it starts to empty, the senders will only be able to send more when they receive ACKs. Because B and C are sharing the 10 Mbit/s link with round robin, they will get an even number of ACKs. Because they get an even number of ACKs they will end up sharing the link equally. Because C is only using 5 Mbit/s of the X to Y link, A will take advantage of the remaining capacity.\n\n5 KEYS FOR TCP SOCKET: Destination Port, Source Port, Destination Address, Source Address, Protocol\n\n2 Conditions collapse: doesn’t do duplicate work and queue never drains empty (should always be doing work)\nInfer loss by: timeout OR duplicate acknowledgements\nDroptail threshold = The number of bytes where the queue starts dropping packets.\n\nReferencing the example from lecture, assuming steps 1, 2, 4 are complete, if you're A, then you've already had your FIN ACKed, so your sender is inactive. Also, you've received B's FIN, so your receiver is inactive. However, you don't know if B has received your ACK that you've received B's FIN, so you need to still linger. This is the case where sender and receiver are inactive but you're still lingering. If you wait for a while (linger) and don't get a retransmission of B's last packet with FIN and ACK of your FIN, then you can assume they got your ACK of their FIN, and stop lingering.	4	{"length": 1417, "index": 4}

A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice, and of consanguinity. We must therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.	2	{"length": 2460, "index": 2}

Where\nwill it take it? The only time I ever saw my father cry was many years later\nwhen he heard that my brother Ameer, whom we called Ammoury,\nhad died. Ameer, who was five years my senior, was transformed\nfrom "Doctor” into “Martyr.” His framed black-and-white photo-\ngraph occupied the heart of the main wall in our living room and\neven a bigger part of my father's heart, which Ammoury had already\nmonopolized.

At the national baccalaureate exams, his score was 95 percent,\nwhich enabled him to go to medical school to study to become a\nsurgeon. Ameer wanted to fulfill his dream of opening a clinic so he\ncould allow Father to retire. Father insisted that he would keep\nworking until he died.

There is no one around and nothing\nin sight except the sand.. I, too, am naked, barefoot, dumbfounded\nby everything around me.. I can feel the sand under my feet and a\ncool wind.. I move slowly toward the bench.. When and why has she\ncome back after all these years?. Her long black hair is piled about\nher head.. A few locks cover her right cheek, as if guarding her face,\nwhich has not changed with the years.. Her eyebrows are carefully\nplucked, and her eyelids, which end in thick eyelashes, are shut.\nHer nose guards her lips, which bear pink lipstick as if she were still\nalive.. Her nipples are erect; there is no trace of the surgery.. Her\nhands are clasped over her navel; her fingernails and toenails are\npainted the same pink as her lipstick.. Her pubic hair is shaved.\nI wonder whether she is asleep or dead.. I am afraid to touch her.. I\nlook into her face and whisper her name, “Reem.” She smiles, her\neyes still shut at first.. Then she opens them, and the blackness in her\npupils smiles as well.. I can't grasp what is going on.. I ask in a loud\nvoice, “Reem, what are you doing here?"\nI am about to hug and kiss her, but she warns me: “Don't kiss me.\nWash me first so we can be together and then .. .. .. ”\n"What?. You are still alive?"\n“Wash me so we can be together.. I missed you so much.”\n“But you are not dead!"\n“Wash me, darling .. .. .. Wash me so we can be together.”\n“With what?. There is nothing here."\n"Wash me, darling."\n1 Raindrops begin to fall, and she closes her eyes.. I wipe a drop off\nher nose with my index finger.. Her skin is warm, which means she is\nalive.. I start to caress her hair.. I will wash her with the rain, I think.\nShe smiles as if she'd heard my thought.. Another drop settles above\nher left eyebrow.. I wipe it off.\nI think I hear a car approaching.. I turn around and see a Humvee\ndriving at an insane speed, leaving a trail of flying dust.. It suddenly\nswerves to the right and comes to a stop a few meters away from us.. Its\ndoors open.. Masked men wearing khaki uniforms and carrying ma-\nchine guns rush toward us.. I try to shield Reem with my right hand,\nbut one of the men has already reached me.. He hits me in the face\nwith the stock of his machine gun.. I fall to the ground.. He kicks me in\nthe stomach.. Another starts dragging me away from the washing\nbench.. None of them says a word..	0	{"length": 2451, "index": 0}

Two men force me to get down on my knees\nand tie my wrists with a wire behind my back.. One of them puts a\nknife to my neck; the other blindfolds me.. I try to run away, but they\nhold me tightly.. I scream again, but cannot hear my screams.. I hear\nonly Reem's shrieks, the laughter and grunts of the men, the sound of\nthe rain.\nI feel a sharp pain, then the cold blade of the knife penetrating\nmy neck.. Hot blood spills over my chest and back.. My head falls to\nthe ground and rolls like a ball on the sand.. I hear footsteps.. One of\nthe men takes off my blindfold and shoves it into his pocket.. He spits\nin my face and goes away.. I see my body to the left of the bench,\nkneeling in a puddle of blood.\nThe other men return to the Humvee, two of them dragging\nReem by her arms.. She tries to turn her head back in my direction,\nbut one of them slaps her.. I cry out her name but can't hear my\nvoice.. They put her in the back seat and shut the door.. The engine\nstarts.. The Humvee speeds away and disappears over the horizon.\nThe rain keeps falling on the empty bench.\nI woke up panting and sweating.. I wiped my forehead and face.. The\nsame nightmare had been recurring for weeks, with minor changes.\n2 Sometimes I saw Reem's severed head on the bench and heard her\nvoice saying, "Wash me, darling,” but this was the first time there\nwas rain.. It must have slipped into my dream from outdoors.. I could\nhear drops on the window next to my bed.\nI looked at my watch.. It was already 3:30 A.M.\nI've slept only three hours after a long and grueling day.. I am\nworn out.\nDeath is not content with what it takes from me in my waking\nhours, it insists on haunting me even in my sleep.. Isn't it enough\nthat I toil all day tending to its eternal guests, preparing them to\nsleep in its lap?. Is death punishing me because I thought I could\nescape its clutches?. If my father were still alive he would mock my\nsilly thoughts.. He would dismiss all this as infantile, unbecoming to\na man.. Didn't he spend a lifetime doing his job day after day, never\nonce complaining of death?. But death back then was timid and\nmore measured than today.\nI can almost hear death saying: “I am what I am and haven't\nchanged at all.. I am but a postman.”\nIf death is a postman, then I receive his letters every day.. I am the\none who opens carefully the bloodied and torn envelopes..	1	{"length": 2422, "index": 1}

Tenfold more than what you used\nto see in the span of a week now pass before me in a day or two.. If you\nwere alive, Father, would you say that that is fate and God's will?. I\nwish you were here so I could leave Mother with you and escape\nwithout feeling guilty.. You were heavily armed with faith, and that\nmade your heart a castle.. My heart, by contrast, is an abandoned\nhouse whose windows are shattered and doors unhinged.. Ghosts\nplay inside it, and the winds wail.\nAs a child, I would cover my head with a second pillow to block\nout noise.. I look for it now; it has fallen by the bed next to my\nslippers.. I pick it up and bury my head under it in order to reclaim\n3 my share of the night.. The image of Reem being dragged away by\nher hair keeps returning.\nReem hadn't been at the heart of my nightmare until a few weeks\nago.. Where was she now?. I heard a few years ago that she was in\nAmsterdam.. I'll Google her again tomorrow when I go to the Inter-\nnet café after work.. I'll try a different spelling of her name in English\nand maybe I'll find something.. But can I just grab a bit of sleep for\nan hour or two?\n4 TWO\nI stood next to my mother on the steps in front of the big\nwooden door.. Her right hand firmly clasped my right hand, as if I\nwere about to run or fly away.. Her left hand carried the sufurtas in\nwhich she packed my father's lunch-three small copper pots, each\nstacked on top of the other in a metal skeleton resembling a little\nmetal building.. The top pot was filled with rice.. The middle one\nwith okra stew and two pieces of meat.. The lower pot usually had\nsome fruit.. That day she'd put in a tiny bunch of white grapes, the\nkind we call "goat nipples," that my father liked.. There was a warm\nloaf of homemade bread in the nylon sack dangling from her left\nwrist.. She put her left foot on the steps and temporarily released my\nhand to knock four times.. Her strong knocks pushed the door open.\nShe pretended not to see the young man squatting a few steps away\nfrom the door with his back to the wall.. He was wearing black.. His\nhead was buried in his hands and he looked like he was wailing.\nSmoke rose from the cigarette in his left hand..	2	{"length": 2433, "index": 2}

In a hushed voice,\nI asked, "Why is this man crying?"\nShe put her index finger on her lips to shush me and whispered,\n“Don't be rude, Jawad!"\nI craned to the left, curious to see what was happening inside.. It\nwas the first time my mother had taken me to my father's place of\nwork.. He usually took the sufurtas with him in the morning, but that\nday he had forgotten to bring it along.\nThe narrow walkway led to a wide room with a high ceiling.\n5 Three or four men were standing at its entrance with their backs\nblocking the scene.. Were they watching my father as he worked?\nThe street was quiet and although the walkway was long, I could\nhear the sound of water being spilled, with my father's voice mutter-\ning phrases I couldn't understand, except for the word "God."\nMy mother knocked at the open door with more force and deter-\nmination this time and then called out “Hammoudy.” None of the\nmen turned around.. Then the one standing to the far left moved\naside and Hammoudy's face appeared.. He limped to the door.. Ham-\nmoudy, my father's assistant, looked older than his actual age.. He\nhad black hair and eyelashes as thick as a paint brush.. He wore blue\nshorts and a white T-shirt which was wet in many spots.. After ex-\nchanging a quick hello, my mother gave him the sufurtas and the\nbread saying: "Here, Hammoudy, this is Abu Ammoury's lunch.. He\nforgot to take it.”\nHe thanked her and rushed back inside after shutting the door.\nShe held my hand again and we started to make our way back\nhome.. I turned back to look at the squatting man.. His head was still\nin his hands.. My mother shook me and said, “Mind where you're\ngoing.. You're going to trip and fall."\nAt that age I didn't know much about my father's work.. All I knew\nwas that he was a mghassilchi, a body-washer, but this word was\nobscure to me.. I was afraid that day and asked my mother: “Does\nFather hurt people?"\n“No son, not at all.. It's quite the opposite.. Why do you ask?"\n"But wasn't that man there crying?"\n"Yes, but not because of your father.. He's just sad."\n“Why is he sad?. What are they doing inside?"\n"Your dad washes the bodies of the dead.. It's a very honorable\nprofession and those who do it are rewarded by God."\n"Why does he wash them?.

Grubach - Then Miss Bürstner\nSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing\nwrong but, one morning, he was arrested.. Every day at eight in the morning he was\nbrought his breakfast by Mrs.. Grubach's cook - Mrs.. Grubach was his landlady - but\ntoday she didn't come.. That had never happened before.. K.. waited a little while, looked\nfrom his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an\ninquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the\nbell.. There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered.. He had never seen\nthe man in this house before.. He was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and\nclose-fitting, with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of which\ngave the impression of being very practical but without making it very clear what they\nwere actually for.. "Who are you?" asked K., sitting half upright in his bed.. The man,\nhowever, ignored the question as if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely\nreplied, "You rang?" "Anna should have brought me my breakfast," said K.. He tried to\nwork out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through observation and by\nthinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to be looked at for very long.. Instead he\nwent over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing\nimmediately behind it, "He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast." There was a little\nlaughter in the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the sound of it whether there\nwere several people laughing.. The strange man could not have learned anything from it\nthat he hadn't known already, but now he said to K., as if making his report "It is not\npossible." "It would be the first time that's happened," said K., as he jumped out of bed\nand quickly pulled on his trousers.. "I want to see who that is in the next room, and why\nit is that Mrs.. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this way." It immediately occurred to\nhim that he needn't have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have\nacknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the\ntime..	0	{"length": 2280, "index": 0}

"I want neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've\nintroduced yourself." "I meant it for your own good," said the stranger and opened the\ndoor, this time without being asked.. The next room, which K.. entered more slowly than\nhe had intended, looked at first glance exactly the same as it had the previous evening.. It\nwas Mrs.. Grubach's living room, over-filled with furniture, tablecloths, porcelain and\nphotographs.. Perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual today, but if so it\nwas not immediately obvious, especially as the main difference was the presence of a\nman sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up.. "You should\nhave stayed in your room!. Didn't Franz tell you?" "And what is it you want, then?" said\nK., looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named Franz, who\nhad remained in the doorway.. Through the open window he noticed the old woman\nagain, who had come close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see everything.. She was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was\ngoing senile.. "I want to see Mrs.. Grubach .... ," said K., making a movement as if tearing\nhimself away from the two men - even though they were standing well away from him\nand wanted to go.. "No," said the man at the window, who threw his book down on a\ncoffee table and stood up.. "You can't go away when you're under arrest." "That's how it\nseems," said K.. "And why am I under arrest?" he then asked.. "That's something we're\nnot allowed to tell you.. Go into your room and wait there.. Proceedings are underway\nand you'll learn about everything all in good time.. It's not really part of my job to be\nfriendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and\nhe's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself.\nIf you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers\nthen you can reckon on things going well with you." K.. wanted to sit down, but then he\nsaw that, apart from the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room\nwhere he could sit.. "You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is," said\nFranz and both men then walked up to K..	1	{"length": 2399, "index": 1}

The two of them\nfelt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower\nquality, but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and\nreturn them to him if his case turned out well.. "It's better for you if you give us the things\nthan if you leave them in the storeroom," they said.. "Things have a tendency to go\nmissing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether\nthe case involved has come to an end or not.. And cases like this can last a long time,\nespecially the ones that have been coming up lately.. They'd give you the money they got\nfor them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're offered for them when they\nsell them that counts, it's how much they get slipped on the side, and things like that lose\ntheir value anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year." K.. paid\nhardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he\nmay have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them.. It was much more\nimportant to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think\nclearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only\nbe policemen - looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K.. looked up\nand saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body.. His strong nose twisted\nto one side as if ignoring K.. and sharing an understanding with the other policeman.\nWhat sort of people were these?. What were they talking about?. What office did they\nbelong to?. K.. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws\nwere decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own home?. He\nwas always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to cross bridges when he came to\nthem, pay no heed for the future, even when everything seemed under threat.. But here\nthat did not seem the right thing to do..	2	{"length": 2106, "index": 2}

There was a very slight\nrisk that people would later say he couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in the habit of learning from experience - he might also have had a few\nunimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he had acted with\nno thought at all for what might follow and had been made to suffer for it.. He didn't want\nthat to happen again, not this time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along\nwith them.\nHe still had time.. "Allow me," he said, and hurried between the two policemen\nthrough into his room.. "He seems sensible enough," he heard them say behind him.\nOnce in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it\nwas very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he\nwas looking for straight away.. He finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go\nback to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty, so he carried on searching\nuntil he found his birth certificate.. Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on\nthe other side opened and Mrs.. Grubach was about to enter.. He only saw her for an\ninstant, for as soon as she recognised K.. she was clearly embarrassed, asked for\nforgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very carefully.. "Do come in,"\nK.. could have said just then.. But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers\nin his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again.. He stayed like that\nuntil he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at\nthe open window and, as K.. now saw, was eating his breakfast.. "Why didn't she come\nin?" he asked.. "She's not allowed to," said the big policeman.. "You're under arrest,\naren't you." "But how can I be under arrest?.	3	{"length": 2384, "index": 3}

"Now you're\nstarting again," said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot.\n"We don't answer questions like that." "You will have to answer them," said K.. "Here\nare my identification papers, now show me yours and I certainly want to see the arrest\nwarrant." "Oh, my God!" said the policeman.. "In a position like yours, and you think\nyou can start giving orders, do you?. It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong\nside, even if you think it will - we're probably more on your side that anyone else you\nknow!" "That's true, you know, you'd better believe it," said Franz, holding a cup of\ncoffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K.. in a way that was\nprobably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood.. K.. found\nhimself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand\ndown on his papers and said, "Here are my identity documents." "And what do you want\nus to do about it?" replied the big policeman, loudly.. "The way you're carrying on, it's\nworse than a child.. What is it you want?. Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of\nyours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us?. We're just\ncoppers, that's all we are.. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card from\nanother, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get\npaid for it.. That's all we are.. Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high\nofficials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and\nwhy he should be arrested, before they issue the warrant.. There's no mistake there.. Our\nauthorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for\nguilt among the public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they\nhave to send us police officers out.. That's the law.. Where d'you think there'd be any\nmistake there?" "I don't know this law," said K.. "So much the worse for you, then," said\nthe policeman.. "It's probably exists only in your heads," said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts\nto his benefit or to make himself at home there..	4	{"length": 2297, "index": 4}

Franz joined in, and said, "Look at this, Willem, he\nadmits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent." "You're quite\nright, but we can't get him to understand a thing," said the other.. K.. stopped talking with\nthem; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up with the\nchattering of base functionaries like this?. - and they admit themselves that they are of the\nlowest position.. They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest\nunderstanding, anyway.. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure\nof themselves.. I just need few words with someone of the same social standing as\nmyself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long\nconversation with these two can make it.. He walked up and down the free space in the\nroom a couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who, now, had\npulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window and had her arms around\nhim.. K.. had to put an end to this display, "Take me to your superior," he said.. "As soon\nas he wants to see you.. Not before," said the policeman, the one called Willem.. "And\nnow my advice to you," he added, "is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait and see\nwhat's to be done with you.. If you take our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking\nabout things to no purpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's going\nto required of you.. You've not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so\ngood to you, you forget that we, whatever we are, we're still free men and you're not, and\nthat's quite an advantage.. But in spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the\nmoney, to go and get you some breakfast from the café over the road."\nWithout giving any answer to this offer, K.. stood still for some time.. Perhaps, if\nhe opened the door of the next room or even the front door, the two of them would not\ndare to stand in his way, perhaps that would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing,\nby bringing it to a head.. But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on\nthe ground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them..	5	{"length": 2318, "index": 5}

Now it was all the\nbreakfast he had and anyway, as he confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it\nwas far better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the policemen\nfrom the dirty café.. He felt well and confident, he had failed to go into work at the bank\nthis morning but that could easily be excused because of the relatively high position he\nheld there.. Should he really send in his explanation?. He wondered about it.. If nobody\nbelieved him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs.. Grubach\nin as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street, who probably even now were\non their way over to the window opposite.. It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking\nat it from the policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left\nhim alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself.. At the same time,\nthough, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so.. Because those two were sitting there in the next room and had\ntaken his breakfast, perhaps?. It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if\nhe had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable.. Maybe, if the\npolicemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental abilities, it could have been\nsupposed that they had come to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him\nalone because of it.. They could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to\nthe cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he first emptied a\nglass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then took a second glassful in order to\ngive himself courage, the last one just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be\nneeded.\nThen he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his\nteeth against the glass.. "The supervisor wants to see you!" a voice said.. It was only the\nshout that startled him, this curt, abrupt, military shout, that he would not have expected\nfrom the policeman called Franz.. In itself, he found the order very welcome..	6	{"length": 2487, "index": 6}

The\ntwo policemen were standing there and chased him back into his bedroom as if that were\na matter of course.. "What d'you think you're doing?" they cried.. "Think you're going to\nsee the supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you?. He'd see to it you got a right\nthumping, and us and all!" "Let go of me for God's sake!" called K., who had already\nbeen pushed back as far as his wardrobe, "if you accost me when I'm still in bed you can't\nexpect to find me in my evening dress." "That won't help you," said the policemen, who\nalways became very quiet, almost sad, when K.. began to shout, and in that way confused\nhim or, to some extent, brought him to his senses.. "Ridiculous formalities!" he grumbled,\nas he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while, as if\nholding it out for the policemen's inspection.. They shook their heads.. "It's got to be a\nblack coat," they said.. At that, K.. threw the coat to the floor and said - without knowing\neven himself what he meant by it - "Well it's not going to be the main trial, after all."\nThe policemen laughed, but continued to insist, "It's got to be a black coat." "Well that's\nalright by me if it makes things go any faster," said K.. He opened the wardrobe himself,\nspent a long time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black suit which\nhad a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out\na fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get dressed.. He secretly told himself that he had\nsucceeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath.\nHe watched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it never occurred\nto them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the\nmessage saying that K.. was getting dressed.\nOnce he was properly dressed, K.. had to pass by Willem as he went through the\nnext room into the one beyond, the door of which was already wide open.. K.. knew very\nwell that this room had recently been let to a typist called 'Miss Bürstner'.. She was in the\nhabit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late, and K.. had never\nexchanged more than a few words of greeting with her.. Now, her bedside table had been\npulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings, and the\nsupervisor sat behind it..	7	{"length": 2479, "index": 7}
7ba77490-6a6c-4936-8048-3358046c7356	d965b179-543b-4778-8bb3-345f5c65788f	He had his legs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the\nbackrest of the chair.. In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the\nphotographs belonging to Miss Bürstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the\nwall.. Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white blouse.. At the window\nacross the street, there was the old pair again, although now their number had increased,\nas behind them, and far taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed\nhis chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers.\n"Josef K.?" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to attract K.'s attention as he looked\nround the room.. K.. nodded.. "I daresay you were quite surprised by all that's been taking\nplace this morning," said the supervisor as, with both hands, he pushed away the few\nitems on the bedside table - the candle and box of matches, a book and a pin cushion\nwhich lay there as if they were things he would need for his own business.. "Certainly,"\nsaid K., and he began to feel relaxed now that, at last, he stood in front of someone with\nsome sense, someone with whom he would be able to talk about his situation.. "Certainly\nI'm surprised, but I'm not in any way very surprised." "You're not very surprised?" asked\nthe supervisor, as he positioned the candle in the middle of the table and the other things\nin a group around it.. "Perhaps you don't quite understand me," K.. hurriedly pointed out.\n"What I mean is\n" here K.. broke off what he was saying and looked round for\nsomewhere to sit.. "I may sit down, mayn't I?" he asked.. "That's not usual," the\nsupervisor answered.. "What I mean is...," said K.. without delaying a second time, "that,\nyes, I am very surprised but when you've been in the world for thirty years already and\nhad to make your own way through everything yourself, which has been my lot, then you\nbecome hardened to surprises and don't take them too hard.. Especially not what's\nhappened today." "Why especially not what's happened today?" "I wouldn't want to say\nthat I see all of this as a joke, you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these\narrangements for that.. Everyone in the house must be taking part in it as well as all of\nyou, that would be going beyond what could be a joke.. So I don't want to say that this is\na joke." "Quite right," said the supervisor, looking to see how many matches were left in\nthe box.. "But on the other hand," K..	8	{"length": 2471, "index": 8}

That follows from the fact that I've\nbeen indicted, but can't think of the slightest offence for which I could be indicted.. But\neven that is all beside the point, the main question is: Who is issuing the indictment?\nWhat office is conducting this affair?. Are you officials?. None of you is wearing a\nuniform, unless what you are wearing" - here he turned towards Franz - "is meant to be a\nuniform, it's actually more of a travelling suit.. I require a clear answer to all these\nquestions, and I'm quite sure that once things have been made clear we can take our leave\nof each other on the best of terms." The supervisor slammed the box of matches down\non the table.. "You're making a big mistake," he said.. "These gentlemen and I have got\nnothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you.. We could\nbe wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like and your situation wouldn't be any\nthe worse for it.. As to whether you're on a charge, I can't give you any sort of clear\nanswer to that, I don't even know whether you are or not.. You're under arrest, you're\nquite right about that, but I don't know any more than that.. Maybe these officers have\nbeen chit-chatting with you, well if they have that's all it is, chit-chat.. I can't give you an\nanswer to your questions, but I can give you a bit of advice: You'd better think less about us and what's going to happen to you, and think a bit more about yourself.. And stop\nmaking all this fuss about your sense of innocence; you don't make such a bad\nimpression, but with all this fuss you're damaging it.. And you ought to do a bit less\ntalking, too.. Almost everything you've said so far has been things we could have taken\nfrom your behaviour, even if you'd said no more than a few words.. And what you have\nsaid has not exactly been in your favour."\nK.. stared at the supervisor.. Was this man, probably younger than he was,\nlecturing him like a schoolmaster?. Was he being punished for his honesty with a telling\noff?. And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were\narresting him?. He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down..	9	{"length": 2350, "index": 9}

He finally came again\nto a halt in front of the supervisor's desk.. "State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of\nmine," he said, "can I telephone him?" "Certainly," said the supervisor, "but I don't know\nwhat the point of that will be, I suppose you must have some private matter you want to\ndiscuss with him." "What the point is?" shouted K., more disconcerted that cross.. "Who\ndo you think you are?. You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out\nsomething as pointless as it could be?. It's enough to make you cry!. These gentlemen\nfirst accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of\nyou.. What point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm ostensibly\nunder arrest?. Very well, I won't make the telephone call." "You can call him if you want\nto," said the supervisor, stretching his had out towards the outer room where the\ntelephone was, "please, go on, do make your phone call." "No, I don't want to any more,"\nsaid K., and went over to the window.. Across the street, the people were still there at the\nwindow, and it was only now that K.. had gone up to his window that they seemed to\nbecome uneasy about quietly watching what was going on.. The old couple wanted to get\nup but the man behind them calmed them down.. "We've got some kind of audience over\nthere," called K.. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger.\n"Go away," he then called across to them.. And the three of them did immediately retreat\na few steps, the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them\nwith the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be\nsaying something incomprehensible into the distance.. They did not disappear entirely,\nthough, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come back to the\nwindow without being noticed.. "Intrusive, thoughtless people!" said K.. as he turned back\ninto the room.. The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K.. thought that was\nwhat he saw from the corner of his eye.. But it was just as possible that he had not even\nbeen listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed to be\ncomparing the length of his fingers..	10	{"length": 2491, "index": 10}

The three young people had put their hands\non their hips and were looking round aimlessly.. Everything was still, like in some office\nthat has been forgotten about.. "Now, gentlemen," called out K., and for a moment it\nseemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, "it looks like your business\nwith me is over with.. In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about whether\nyou're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake.. If you are of the same opinion, then please.... " and he walked up to\nthe supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him.. The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his\nlip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the supervisor would do as he\nsuggested.. But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss\nBürstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new\nhat.. "Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it," he said to K.. as he did so, "so you\nthink we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do you.. No, no, that won't do.\nMind you, on the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for\nyou.. No, why should you think that?. You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that.\nThat's what I had to tell you, that's what I've done and now I've seen how you've taken it.\nThat's enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at\nleast.. I expect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you." "In to the bank?" asked\nK., "I thought I was under arrest." K.. said this with a certain amount of defiance as,\nalthough his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more independent of all\nthese people, especially since the supervisor had stood up.. He was playing with them.. If\nthey left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let them arrest him.. That's\nwhy he even repeated, "How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?" "I see\nyou've misunderstood me," said the supervisor who was already at the door.. "It's true that\nyou're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job.. And there\nshouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual life." "In that case it's not\ntoo bad, being under arrest," said K., and went up close to the supervisor..	11	{"length": 2446, "index": 11}

"It hardly seems to have been necessary notify me\nof the arrest in that case," said K., and went even closer.. The others had also come\ncloser.. All of them had gathered together into a narrow space by the door.. "That was my\nduty," said the supervisor.. "A silly duty," said K., unyielding.. "Maybe so," replied the\nsupervisor, "only don't let's waste our time talking on like this.. I had assumed you'd be\nwanting to go to the bank.. As you're paying close attention to every word I'll add this:\nI'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to.. And to make\nthings easier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put\nthese three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal." "What's that?" exclaimed\nK., and looked at the three in astonishment.. He could only remember seeing them in\ntheir group by the photographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were\nindeed officials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it\nshowed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior\nmembers of staff at the bank.. How could K.. have failed to see that?. How occupied he\nmust have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to have recognised these three!\nRabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair\nand deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle\nspasms.. "Good morning," said K.. after a while, extending his hand to the gentlemen as\nthey bowed correctly to him.. "I didn't recognise you at all.. So, we'll go into work now,\nshall we?" The gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they\nhad been waiting for all the time, except that K.. had left his hat in his room so they all\ndashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a certain amount of\nembarrassment.. K.. stood where he was and watched them through the open double\ndoorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no\nmore than an elegant trot.. Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the.	12	{"length": 2215, "index": 12}

We did not fully realize it at the time, but a key reason for the broad appeal of “heuristics and biases” outside psychology was an incidental feature of our work: we almost always included in our articles the full text of the questions we had asked ourselves and our respondents. These questions served as demonstrations for the reader, allowing him to recognize how his own thinking was tripped up by cognitive biases.

In part A.. the problem essentially\nasks given there is at least one boy in two children, what is the conditional probability\nthat both children are boys.. Part B asks that given one child is a boy, what is the\nconditional probability that the other child is also a boy.. For both parts, we need to\nassume that each child is equal likely to be a boy or a girl.\nAll-girl world?\nIn a primitive society, every couple prefers to have a baby girl.. There is a 50% chance\nthat each child they have is a girl, and the genders of their children are mutually\nindependent.. If each couple insists on having more children until they get a girl and once\nthey have a girl they will stop having more children, what will eventually happen to the\nfraction of girls in this society?\nSolution: It was surprising that many interviewees include many who studied\nprobability have the misconception that there will be more girls.. Do not let the word\n"prefer" and a wrong intuition misguide you.. The fraction of baby girls are driven by\nnature, or at least the X and Y chromosomes, not by the couples' preference.. You only\nneed to look at the key information: 50% and independence.. Every new-born child has\nequal probability of being a boy or a girl regardless of the gender of any other children.\nSo the fraction of girls born is always 50% and the fractions of girls in the society will\nstay stable at 50%.\nUnfair coin\nYou are given 1000 coins.. Among them, I coin has heads on both sides.. The other 999\ncoins are fair coins.. You randomly choose a coin and toss it 10 times.. Each time, the\ncoin turns up heads.. What is the probability that the coin you choose is the unfair one?\nSolution: This is a classic conditional probability question that uses Bayes' theorem.. Let\nA be the event that the chosen coin is the unfair one, then A is the event that the chosen\ncoin is a fair one.. Let B be the event that all ten tosses turn up heads.. Apply Bayes\ntheorem we have P(A/B) =\nP(B. A)P(A)\nP(B. A)P(A)\nP(B) P(B. A)P(A) + P(B. A)P(A)\nThe priors are P(A)=1/1000 and P(A)=999/1000.. If the coin is unfair, it always\nturns up heads, so P(B. A) = 1.. If the coin is fair, each time it has 1/2 probability turning\nA Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews\nup heads..

A)P(A)+P(B. A) P(A) 1/1000×1+999/1000×1/1024\n≈\n0.5.\nFair probability from an unfair coin\nIf you have an unfair coin, which may bias toward either heads or tails at an unknown\nprobability, can you generate even odds using this coin?\nSolution: Unlike fair coins, we clearly can not generate even odds with one toss using an\nunfair coin.. How about using 2 tosses?. Let p₁₄ be the probability the coin will yield\nhead, and py be the probability the coin will yield tails (p₄ + pr=1).. Consider two\nindependent tosses.. We have four possible outcomes HH, HT, TH and TT with\nprobabilities P(HH) = PHPH P(HT) = PuPc, P(TH) = PrPH, and P(TT) = PrPr\nSo we have P(HT) = P(TH).. By assigning HT to winning and TH to losing, we can\ngenerate even odds.. 12\nDart game\nVon Neuman algorithm\nJason throws two darts at a dartboard, aiming for the center.. The second dart lands\nfarther from the center than the first.. If Jason throws a third dart aiming for the center,\nwhat is the probability that the third throw is farther from the center than the first?\nAssume Jason's skillfulness is constant.\nSolution: A standard answer directly applies the conditional probability by enumerating\nall possible outcomes.. If we rank the three darts' results from the best (A) to the worst\n(C), there are 6 possible outcomes with equal probability:\n12 I should point out that this simple approach is not the most efficient approach since I am disregarding\nthe cases HH and TT.. When the coin has high bias (one side is far more likely than the other side to occur),\nthe method may take many runs to generate one useful result.. For more complex algorithm that increasing\nefficiency, please refer to Tree Algorithms for Unbiased Coin Tossing with a Biased Coin by Quentin F.\nStout and Bette L.. Warren..

Though Humbert’s couching of his loss in Poe’s poem creates an air of aestheticized falsity, late in the novel, when he realizes “the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised–the great rosegray never-to-be-had,” are we only tricked by Humbert, or is there a shred of truth? And one cannot forget that his experiences with Annabelle were constantly limited by the social realities permitted by their caretakers—perhaps we can say Humbert’s constant obsession with the transgressive is a scintillation between a desire to securely satisfy and utterly destroy the societal norms which, in combination with typhus, ensured the rosegray could never be had. After all, Humbert says he was “perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for.” Here, the demoniac is not only the nymphophilic monstrosity it becomes, but, unrecognized by Humbert, also a misanthropic loathing of societal rules, compressed by his experiences with childhood sexuality, which incubates in his uniquely sociopathic mind to become his awful crime.	4	{"length": 1433, "index": 4}

The top row highlights the relationship between performance and the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the rules, while the bottom row categorizes the performance by Wolfram’s complexity classes. For clarity, two representative rules from each complexity class are displayed on the left, with their corresponding performance annotated in the top plots. For the reasoning tasks, models generally achieve near-perfect accuracy when trained for sufficient long time. Therefore, instead of reporting absolute accuracy, we focus on model efficiency, defined as the inverse of the number of epochs required to reach 80% accuracy. The chess task is sufficiently difficult that models do not achieve perfect performance, and so we report the final accuracy.

Like all of these characters, Pnin experiences the moment where the mind remembers an otherworldly tragedy: “no conscience, and hence no consciousness, could be expected to subsist in a world where such things as Mira’s death were possible.” And this tightness in Pnin’s chest, this dissolutive experience, articulates on the page with the narrator’s description of Gramineev’s easel. This moment is for Pnin, like for Proust, and for Humbert, the result of an atemporal rupture in the supposedly transcendent metaphysics of prevailing moral systems, a trauma which was lodged in consciousness and yet disallows all consciousness, and which is the birthplace of Nabokov’s aesthetic tingle. Because as readers we know what it is impossible for the narrator to see — that the two dark figures on the easel, silhouettes in profile against the ember-red sky, are not the Poroshin girl and her beau, or Nina Bolotov and young Poroshin; they are Pnin, and Mira.	5	{"length": 1178, "index": 5}

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far\n\naway, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote\n\ngrey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.\n\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning\n\nhad sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!\n\nWith that he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-\n\nbearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder.\n\nAnd straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in\n\nmusic, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour\n\nwas like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the\n\nmountains.\n\nRide now, ride now!

After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Eomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his\n\nspeed, and the front of the first e ored roared like a breaker\n\nfoaming to the shore, but Theoden could not be overtaken.\n\nFey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new\n\nfire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a\n\ngod of old, even as Orome ¨ the Great in the battle of the Valar\n\nwhen the world was young.

For morning\n\ncame, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was\n\nremoved, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took\n\nthem, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode\n\nover them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song,\n\nand they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them,\n\nand the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came\n\neven to the City.	1	{"length": 1119, "index": 1}

Outside of the rich countries, average health\nis strongly correlated with income. As shown in Figure 1, the current version of a\ngraph first drawn by Preston (1975) in which countries are represented by circles\nand the size of the circle is proportional to population, life-expectancy is pro-\nfoundly lower for countries with lower levels of per capita income.\nIn the years just after World War II, life expectancy gaps between countries\nwere falling across the world.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic and the\ntransition in Russia and eastern Europe have changed that situation. The best\nestimates of life-expectancy in some sub-Saharan African countries are lower now\nthan they were in 1950. Life expectancy in Russia fell by nearly seven years over the\n1990s. However, at least up to the 1990s, compound welfare measures that incor-\nporate both health and income show both much greater inequality at any point in\ntime and much greater international convergence than do income measures alone\n(Becker, Philipson and Soares, 2005).\nThere is also a positive relationship between income and health within\ncountries-low-income people live shorter lives than high-income people in a given\ncountry. Americans in the bottom 5 percent of the income distribution in 1980 had\na life-expectancy at all ages that was about 25 percent lower than the corresponding\nlife-expectancies of those in the top 5 percent of the income distribution (Rogot,\nSorlie, Johnson and Schmitt, 1992).

For example, American blacks had a life expectancy in 2002 that\nwas 5.4 years less than that of American whites. In England and Wales in 1997–2001,\nmale manual workers could expect to live 8.4 years less than professionals, a gap\nthat has increased since the early 1970s.\nThe decline in mortality over time, differences in mortality across countries\nand differences in mortality across groups within countries are phenomena worthy\nof serious attention by economists and others. We will first lay out the historical\ndecline in mortality, then move to mortality differences between rich and poor\ncountries, and then discuss differences in mortality within countries. A good theory\nof mortality should explain all of the facts we will outline. No such theory exists at\npresent, but at the end of the paper we will sketch a tentative synthesis.\nDeterminants of the Historical Decline in Mortality\nFor most of human history, life was properly described in the famous phrase of\nThomas Hobbes as “nasty, brutish, and short.” From the dawn of Homo sapiens\nperhaps 100,000 years ago until the first agricultural revolution in roughly 10,000\nBCE, world population was about four million people. Life expectancy at birth for\nour hunter-gatherer ancestors was perhaps 25 years. There had been little, if any,\nprogress by the Roman Empire, and even in 1700, life expectancy at birth in\nEngland-after the Netherlands, the richest country in the world at the time—was\nonly 37 years (Wrigley and Schofield, 1981).\nIn the eighteenth century, mortality began to decline. In England and Wales\n(which we refer to as “England” for convenience), the decline started around the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. By 1820, life expectancy at birth in England was\nabout 41 years, up six years over the previous century. Between 1820 and 1870, the\nperiod of greatest industrialization, life expectancy remained stable at about\n41 years. Since 1870, mortality has fallen relatively continuously as well as more\nrapidly than in the first phase of mortality decline. Life expectancy in England\nclimbed to 50 years in the first decade of the twentieth century, and is about 77\nyears today. A similar transition, with some moderate differences in timing, took\nplace in all developed countries. Mortality reduction in France was broadly similar\nto that in England. In the United States, the mortality reduction appears to start\naround 1790, with a similar overall pattern. Life expectancy at birth in the United\nStates rose from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years today.\nThe reduction in mortality was not uniform by age. The vast bulk of the\nhistorical reduction in mortality occurred at younger ages. Figure 2 shows trends in\nlife expectancy by age in England since 1840. Between 1841 and 1950, life expect-\nancy at birth increased by 30 years, while life expectancy at age ten increased by\nonly half that amount. The decline in infectious disease explains this disparate age\npattern. In 1848, 60 percent of deaths in England were from infectious disease.\nBetween then and 1971, infectious disease mortality declined by 95 percent. Since	2	{"length": 3256, "index": 2}

The sources of the reduction in infec-\ntious disease mortality have been extensively debated in the demographic commu-\nnity. We discuss the relevant factors in (possible) order of historical importance and\nconclude with some open issues.\nImproved Nutrition\nAgricultural yields increased significantly during the eighteenth century. Better-\nfed people resist most bacterial (although not viral) disease better, and recover\nmore rapidly and more often. The British physician and demographer Thomas\nMcKeown was the first person to argue for the importance of nutrition in improved\nhealth, writing several seminal papers on the topic which culminated in his widely\nread 1976 book. McKeown argued by residual analysis: neither personal health care\nnor public health appeared to have had much impact prior to the 1900s, when most\nof the mortality decline had already occurred. In a famous example, McKeown\nshowed that mortality from tuberculosis fell by 80 percent before there was any\neffective treatment for the disease. The same is true for other infectious diseases as\nwell. However, many analysts found unconvincing both McKeown's dismissal of\npublic health, as well as the argument by elimination that nutrition was the crucial\nfactor (for example, Szreter, 1988; Guha, 1994).\nDirect evidence on the role of nutrition in improved health and mortality\nreduction comes from the work of Robert Fogel, in a series of papers summarized	3	{"length": 1961, "index": 3}
842455c4-54b7-4c4c-8504-1d0606bccd12	12953a0e-8f21-4e02-8a9d-53074301bd9a	The Determinants of Mortality 101\nin Fogel (1997) and in his 2004 book. Fogel begins by showing the enormous\nincrease in caloric intake after the middle of the eighteenth century, measured\nboth directly from agricultural output and diary surveys, and indirectly through\nchanges in adult height. Between the middle of the eighteenth century and today,\nfor example, caloric intake per person increased by more than a third, and heights\nin most of Europe increased by ten centimeters or more (Fogel, 1994, Table 1).\nMortality is U-shaped in the body mass index (weight divided by height squared),\nand declines with height given the body mass index. Fogel (1997) uses these\nrelationships to argue that nearly all of the reduction in mortality from the late\neighteenth century to the late nineteenth century can be attributed to improved\nnutrition, as well as half of the mortality improvement in the century after that.\nBut the evidence on calorie availability has not convinced everyone. One line\nof argument is that the increase in life expectancy in England from 1750 to 1820\nhad nothing to do with increased income per head, but was just one of the\nfluctuations in mortality that characterized pre-industrial Europe. Indeed, Wrigley\nand Schofield (1981) estimate that life expectancy in 1600 was the same as in 1820,\nwith 1750 being the low point of a two-century swing. Steckel (2004) argues on the\nbasis of skeletal remains that people were taller (and presumably better nourished)\nin early medieval times. If we accept this argument and date the modern decrease\nin mortality from 1870, when it began in earnest in England and several other\nEuropean countries, the link between economic growth and mortality becomes\ntenuous, because the timing of the beginnings of modern growth is far more\ndispersed across countries than is the onset of the modern mortality decline\n(Easterlin, 2004). Also, as we shall see, improvements in public health offer a more\ncoherent explanation for mortality declines after 1870.\nAnother concern with the nutritional story is that, from the sixteenth to the\neighteenth centuries, English aristocrats had no life expectancy advantage over the\nrest of the population, despite presumably better nutrition. Moreover, mortality was\nnot lower in well-fed populations of the same period, such as in the United States\n(Livi-Bacci, 1991).\nFurther, there are powerful two-way interactions between disease and nutri-\ntion. Children who are frequently malnourished often continually suffer from\npoorly-controlled infectious disease. Diseases such as diarrhea prevent food intake\nfrom nourishing the body; children who suffer repeated episodes of diarrhea may\nbe able to digest less than 80 percent of what they consume (Dasgupta and Ray,\n1990). As a result, some argue that it was disease, not nutrition, that was the primary\nexogenous influence, and that disease burdens changed most strongly as a result of\npublic health intervention.\nPublic Health\nThe argument for the role of public health in reduced mortality is made most\nprominently by Samuel Preston (1975, 1980, 1996). If economic growth were the\nsole reason for improved health, countries would move along the “Preston curve”\nshown in Figure 1, but the curve itself would remain fixed. However, even at a given	4	{"length": 3289, "index": 4}

For\nexample, China in 2000 has the income level of the United States in the 1880s, but\nhas the life expectancy of the United States in 1970—about 72 years. Preston\nestimates that only about 15 percent of the increase in life expectancy between the\n1930s and 1960s is a result of increases in income alone (Preston, 1975). While\nincome was certainly mismeasured historically, creating uncertainty in this esti-\nmate, there is no recorded income in 1930 that would have predicted the life\nexpectancy observed in many countries in 1960.\nPublic health improvements are an obvious explanation for this shift. Macro\npublic health involves big public works projects: filtering and chlorinating water\nsupplies, building sanitation systems, draining swamps, pasteurizing milk and un-\ndertaking mass vaccination campaigns. Micro public health involves changes made\nby individuals but encouraged by the public sector, including boiling bottles and\nmilk, protecting food from insects, washing hands, ventilating rooms and keeping\nchildren's vaccinations up to date. Macro public health was always present to some\nextent. Even in the Middle Ages, it was known that people living in areas where\nbubonic plague was rampant should be quarantined. (Unfortunately, rats were not\nquarantined.) Benjamin Latrobe built a water system in Philadelphia early in the\nnineteenth century, at least partly to reduce the disease burden. In 1854 John Snow\ncompared cholera fatalities between households supplied by two different water\ncompanies, one of which was recycling human waste, and one of which was not. He\nthus demonstrated that cholera was water-borne and that its spread could be halted\nby uncontaminated water supplies. But big public health did not fully come into its\nown until the acceptance of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s and 1890s,\nwhich led to a wave of new public health initiatives and the conveyance of safe\nhealth practices to individuals.\nThe dramatic reduction in water and food-borne diseases after that time—\ntyphoid, cholera, dysentery, and non-respiratory tuberculosis—highlights the role\nof public health. From a mortality rate of 214 per 100,000 in 1848–54, these\ndiseases were virtually eliminated in the United States by 1970. By one estimate,\nwater purification alone can explain half of the mortality reduction in the United\nStates in the first third of the twentieth century (Cutler and Miller, 2005).\nUrbanization\nIf rising living standards were good for health, urbanization was not, at least\ninitially. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that the lack of improvement\nin mortality between 1820 and 1870 was due in large part to the greater spread of\ndisease in newly enlarged cities. Nutrition may or may not be the culprit here;\ndebate about whether nutrition and real wages were rising or falling in the middle\nof the nineteenth century continues to rage. But the effect of unsanitary conditions\nwas larger and the spread of disease was easier in bigger, more crowded cities.	5	{"length": 3124, "index": 5}

Over the course of the twentieth century, however, the role of\nmedical advances increased in importance.\nThe first important medical interventions were vaccinations. Variolation\nagainst smallpox, practiced in China as early as the tenth century, was an early form\nof immunization whereby matter from the scabs of previous victims was introduced\ninto the bodies of healthy people. Variolation was introduced to Europe from\nTurkey and to the American colonies by African slaves in the early eighteenth\ncentury. George Washington variolated his entire army. Vaccination was intro-\nduced by Edward Jenner at the end of the eighteenth century, but wide-scale\nresearch on vaccines depended on the germ theory of disease and did not occur\nuntil a century later. Since the late nineteenth century, there have been a number\nof new vaccines, including those for rabies (1885), plague (1897), diphtheria\n(1923), pertussis (1926), tuberculosis (1927), tetanus (1927), yellow fever (1935),\npolio (1955 and 1962), measles (1964), mumps (1967), rubella (1970), and hep-\natitis B (1981).\nThe morbidity consequences of these diseases were high, but the best available\nhistorical data suggest that, in the now-rich countries, direct mortality from these\ndiseases was relatively rare immediately prior to introduction of these vaccines, except\nfor tuberculosis. As many as half a million people contracted measles in the United\nStates just before the vaccine was developed, for example, but measles directly ac-\ncounted for fewer than 1,000 deaths. Exclusive of tuberculosis, reductions in these\ncauses of death account for only 3 percent of the total mortality reduction. The\nreduction in tuberculosis mortality is another 10 percent, but in the United States,\nunlike most other countries, the tuberculosis vaccine has never been routinely used, so\nnone of the reduction was due to vaccination. These conclusions parallel those of\nMcKeown; the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis was widely used in Britain, but without any\nevidence of an effect on trend mortality. Apart from polio, the same is true for the\nintroduction of other vaccines. Of course, the indirect consequences of eliminating\ninfectious diseases may be greater; people with measles may succumb more readily to\nother diseases, for example. Evidence suggests there are indirect mortality effects for\nsome water-born diseases (Cutler and Miller, 2005), but the extent of such indirect\neffects in the disease environment as a whole is not known.\nMedical Treatments\nQuantitatively more important for mortality was the development of new\ntherapeutics for people with disease. Figure 3 shows mortality for infectious diseases\nand cardiovascular disease. Infectious disease declined greatly in the first half of the\ncentury, while cardiovascular disease mortality reductions were particularly impor-\ntant after 1960.\nAntibiotics, developed in the 1930s and 1940s, were the first of the new wave\nof medical therapies. Sulfa drugs and penicillin were the wonder drugs of their era.\nBy 1960, mortality from infectious diseases had declined to its current level.	6	{"length": 3261, "index": 6}

Since\n1960, cardiovascular disease mortality has declined by over 50 percent, and cardio-\nvascular disease mortality reductions account for 70 percent of the seven-year\nincrease in life expectancy between 1960 and 2000. Cutler (2004) matches the\nresults of clinical trials to actual mortality declines, and attributes the bulk of the\ndecline in cardiovascular disease mortality—as much as two-thirds of the reduc-\ntion—to medical advance. Beyond medical advance, the major factor in reduced\ncardiovascular disease mortality is the reduction in smoking. Smoking rates in the\nUnited States have fallen to half their level at the time of the Surgeon General's\n1964 report on the harms of smoking. Continued public health campaigns against\ntobacco use have been an important part of this decline.\nAn additional 19 percent of the increase in life expectancy since 1960 is a result\nof reduced infant mortality. Cutler (2004) attributes a large share of continued\ninfant mortality reductions to improved neonatal medical care for low birth-weight\ninfants. The remainder of the decline in mortality since the 1960s includes reduced\nmortality from external causes, primarily motor vehicle accidents, reduced mortal-\nity from pneumonia/influenza, and a slight decrease in cancer mortality.\nThe importance of medical technology and smoking behavior can also be seen\nin the simultaneous decline and rapid convergence of mortality rates for all\ndeveloped countries, particularly for men, and particularly for cardiovascular dis-\nease.

In particular, we will represent arbitrary (Unicode)\nstrings as a sequence of bytes and train our BPE tokenizer on this byte sequence.. Later, we will use this\ntokenizer to encode text (a string) into tokens (a sequence of integers) for language modeling.\n2.1 The Unicode Standard\nUnicode is a text encoding standard that maps characters to integer code points.. As of Unicode 15.1 (released\nin September 2023), the standard defines 149,813 characters across 161 scripts.. For example, the character\n"s" has the code point 115 (typically notated as U+0073, where U+ is a conventional prefix and 0073 is 115 in\nhexadecimal), and the character“牛”has the code point 29275.. In Python, you can use the ord() function\nto convert a single Unicode character into its integer representation.. The chr() function converts an integer\nUnicode code point into a string with the corresponding character.\n>>> ord('牛')\n29275\n>>> chr (29275)\n'牛'\n2 Problem (unicode1): Understanding Unicode (1 point)\n(a) What Unicode character does chr(0) return?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(b) How does this character's string representation (__repr__()) differ from its printed representation?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(c) What happens when this character occurs in text?.	1	{"length": 2453, "index": 1}

Instead, we'll use a Unicode encoding, which\nconverts a Unicode character into a sequence of bytes.. The Unicode standard itself defines three encodings:\nUTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, with UTF-8 being the dominant encoding for the Internet (more than 98%\nof all webpages).\nTo encode a Unicode string into UTF-8, we can use the encode() function in Python.. To access the\nunderlying byte values for a Python bytes object, we can iterate over it (e.g., call list()).. Finally, we can\nuse the decode() function to decode a UTF-8 byte string into a Unicode string.\n>>> test_string = "hello!. こんにちは!"\n>>> utf8_encoded = test_string.encode("utf-8")\n>>> print(utf8_encoded)\nb'hello!. \\xe3\\x81\\x93\\xe3\\x82\\x93\\xe3\\x81\\xab\\xe3\\x81\\xa1\\xe3\\x81\\xaf!'\n>>> print (type(utf8_encoded))\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> # Get the byte values for the encoded string (integers from 0 to 255).\n>>> list (utf8_encoded)\n[104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33, 32, 227, 129, 147, 227, 130, 147, 227, 129, 171, 227, 129,\n161, 227, 129, 175, 33]\n>>> # One byte does not necessarily correspond to one Unicode character!\n>>> print(len(test_string))\n13\n>>> print (len(utf8_encoded))\n23\n>>> print (utf8_encoded.decode("utf-8"))\nhello!. こんにちは!\nBy converting our Unicode codepoints into a sequence of bytes (e.g., via the UTF-8 encoding), we are\nessentially taking a sequence of codepoints (integers in the range 0 to 149,812) and transforming it into a\n3 sequence of byte values (integers in the range 0 to 255).. The 256-length byte vocabulary is much more\nmanageable to deal with.. When using byte-level tokenization, we do not need to worry about out-of-\nvocabulary tokens, since we know that any input text can be expressed as a sequence of integers from 0 to\n255.\nProblem (unicode2): Unicode Encodings (3 points)\n(a) What are some reasons to prefer training our tokenizer on UTF-8 encoded bytes, rather than\nUTF-16 or UTF-32?.	2	{"length": 2453, "index": 2}

Why is this function incorrect?. Provide an example of an input byte string\nthat yields incorrect results.\ndef decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong (bytestring: bytes):\nreturn "".join([bytes([b]).decode("utf-8") for b in bytestring])\n>>> decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong("hello".encode("utf-8"))\n'hello'\nDeliverable: An example input byte string for which decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong pro-\nduces incorrect output, with a one-sentence explanation of why the function is incorrect.\n(c) Give a two byte sequence that does not decode to any Unicode character(s).\nDeliverable: An example, with a one-sentence explanation.\n2.3 Subword Tokenization\nWhile byte-level tokenization can alleviate the out-of-vocabulary issues faced by word-level tokenizers, to-\nkenizing text into bytes results in extremely long input sequences.. This slows down model training, since\na sentence with 10 words might only be 10 tokens long in a word-level language model, but could be 50 or\nmore tokens long in a character-level model (depending on the length of the words).. Processing these longer\nsequences requires more computation at each step of the model.. Furthermore, language modeling on byte\nsequences is difficult because the longer input sequences create long-term dependencies in the data.\nSubword tokenization is a midpoint between word-level tokenizers and byte-level tokenizers.. Note that a\nbyte-level tokenizer's vocabulary has 256 entries (byte values are 0 to 225).. A subword tokenizer trades-off a\nlarger vocabulary size for better compression of the input byte sequence.. For example, if the byte sequence\nb'the' often occurs in our raw text training data, assigning it an entry in the vocabulary would reduce this\n3-token sequence to a single token.\nHow do we select these subword units to add to our vocabulary?. Sennrich et al.. [2016] propose to use\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE; Gage, 1994), a compression algorithm that iteratively replaces (“merges”) the\nmost frequent pair of bytes with a single, new unused index..	3	{"length": 2260, "index": 3}

We overreact\nto some risks and virtually ignore others. Often too much weight is placed on risks\nof low probability but high salience (such as those posed by trace carcinogens or\nterrorist action); risks of commission rather than omission; and risks, such as those\nassociated with frontier technologies, whose magnitude is difficult to estimate. Too\nlittle effort is spent ameliorating voluntary risks, such as those involving auto-\nmobiles and diet. When the bearers of risk do not share in the costs of reduction,\nmoreover, extravagance is likely.\nPart of the problem is that we rely on a mix of individual, corporate, and\ngovernment decisions to respond to risk. Our traditional coordinating mecha-\nnisms-markets and government action-are crippled by inadequate information,\ncostly decision-making processes, and the need to accommodate citizens' misper-\nceptions, sometimes arising from imbalances in media attention.\nRisk can never be entirely eliminated from life, and reductions come at a price (in\ndollars, foregone pleasures, or both). Our current muddled approach makes it diffi-\ncult to reach wise, well-informed decisions as to the preferred balance of risk and\ncost. Some risks we ignore; some small ones we regulate stringently. Worse, our\noverreaction to very small risks impedes the kind of technological progress that has\nhistorically brought dramatic improvements in both health and material well-being.\nIn addition, we are likely to misdirect our efforts, for example, by focusing on risks\nthat command attention in the political process, such as newly identified car-\ncinogens, rather than those where the greatest gains in well-being are available,\nsuch as individual life-style choices.2\nOur regulatory efforts focus too much on equipment and physical processes, too\nlittle on human error and venality. We may set stringent emission standards, which\nimpose high costs per unit of environmental quality gained, yet ignore the haphaz-\nard operation of nuclear weapons plants.\nEvidently willing to expend substantial resources to reduce risk, our society\nseems reluctant to look closely at the bargains it has struck. Unless we reorient our\nrisk-management policies, we will continue to pay more than we should for health\ngains that are less than we could achieve.\nThe success of risk-management policies should be judged in terms of their effect\non expected utility. 3 In practice, the choices made by human beings under uncertain-\n()	1	{"length": 2564, "index": 1}

Upon\nreflection, however, most people would accept the theory's axiomatic underpin-\nnings. (There is no well-developed competing prescriptive theory for choice under\nuncertainty.)\nThe formulation of risk policy should then begin by asking what outcomes would\nresult from perfectly functioning market processes if individuals behaved so as to\nmaximize their own expected utility. What level of adverse side effects from phar-\nmaceuticals would be acceptable if we knew the risk and could take the time and\neffort to make sound decisions? Our hypothetical market should be open to future\ngenerations. If they could compensate the present generation for preserving re-\nsources and the environment, what environmental decisions would we make today?\nSuch a thought experiment should guide our efforts to bequeath posterity an efficient\nmix of technological capabilities, environmental quality, and cultural attainments.\n9.2 HUMAN FALLIBILITY IN RESPONSES TO RISKS\nDecisions involving risks illustrate the limits of human rationality, as a substantial\nrecent literature documents. 4 Perhaps the most fundamental problem is that individ-\nuals have great difficulty comprehending extremely low-probability events, such as\ndifferentiating a risk of 10-7 from a risk 100 times as large, 10-5. When assessing\nsuch risks, even scientists may not appreciate how much greater the payoff is that\ncomes from addressing the larger probability.\nThe numerous decision-making problems that arise with respect to small proba-\nbilities are individually of little consequence. Expected welfare loss from any single\nerror may well be negligible. Aggregated, however, low-probability events make up\na large part of an individual's risk level. Even truly substantial risks, such as the\nchance of death from a stroke-roughly 1/2,000 annually averaged over the\npopulation-are usually influenced by a myriad of decisions, each of which has\nonly a small probabilistic impact on our longevity. Systematic errors in these deci-\nsions might have an enormous cumulative effect.\nMistakes in Estimation\nWhereas people generally overestimate the likelihood of low-probability events\n(death by tornado), they underestimate higher risk levels (heart disease or stroke).5\nWe are particularly likely to overestimate previously unrecognized risks in the\naftermath of an unfavorable outcome. Such perceptional biases account for the\nemotional public response to such events as Three Mile Island, or occasional inci-\ndents of deliberate poisoning of foodstuffs or medicines.\nRisk perceptions may also be affected by the visibility of a risk, by fear associated\nwith it, and by the extent to which individuals believe they can exercise control over\nit. Consider the greenhouse effect. Although global warming is a prime concern of\nthe Environmental Protection Agency, it ranks only twenty-third among the U.S.\npublic's environmental concerns.7 The high risk of automobile fatality-car acci-\ndents kill one in 5,000 Americans each years-might perhaps be reduced signifi-	2	{"length": 3122, "index": 2}

For example, the\nrecord high temperatures of 1988 may or may not have been signals of an impending\ngreenhouse effect. Unfortunately, such signals are seldom as informative as can-\naries in the coal mine. Adverse events may occur without warning; witness the San\nFrancisco earthquake in October 1989. Moreover, happenstance warnings may bear\nlittle relation to the magnitude, likelihood, or nature of a problem. Forest manage-\nment efforts should not have to await the chance burning of national parks and\nforests.\nDistortions in Monetary Valuation\nEconomic valuations of risk also tend to be distorted by underlying misweighting of\nrisks. For example, from an expected utility perspective, individuals generally place\ntoo high a value on preventing increases in a risk from its current level (the so-called\nstatus quo bias or reference risk effect. 10 These tendencies are reflected in govern-\nment policy. Products causing new forms of cancer tend to arouse greater public\nconcern, and new technologies are often regulated much more strictly than are old\ntechnologies and familiar risks. 11 Man-made carcinogens are carefully scrutinized,\nwhile much higher levels of natural carcinogens may be tolerated. Because of this\nimbalance, we pay more dollars for our products and end up with greater risks to our\nlives.\nStudies of consumers show that many individuals would be willing to pay a\npremium for the assured elimination of a risk. 12 The Russian roulette problem\nillustrates. Consider two alternative scenarios for a forced round of play. In the first,\nyou have the option to purchase and remove one bullet from a gun that has three\nbullets in its six chambers. How much would you pay for this reduction in risk?\n(Assume you are unmarried, with no children.) In the second situation, the gun has\nonly a single bullet. How much would you pay to buy back this bullet? From an\neconomic standpoint, you should always be willing to pay at least as much and\ntypically more in the first situation since there is some chance you will be killed by\none of the remaining bullets, in which case money is worthless (or worth less). 13\nHowever, experiments find respondents are typically willing to pay more when a\nsingle bullet is in the gun, because its removal will ensure survival. 14\nThe Chilean grape scare provides a recent example of a risk that does not lend\nitself to statistical estimation or scientific assessment. Neither the government nor\nconsumers could estimate how much consumers' risk was increased by the discov-\nery of traces of cyanide in two Chilean grapes in Philadelphia. 15 When precise\nscientific judgments concerning probabilities are elusive, regret is likely to play a\nsignificant role. 16 If societal norms were flouted, regret would be greater still. (Few\nof us would leave a baby sleeping alone in a house while we drove off on a ten-\nminute errand, even though car-crash risks are much greater than home risks.)\nHindsight is frequently able to identify why an individual or society should have\nknown certain risk estimates were far too low, as we "learned" from the highway	3	{"length": 3421, "index": 3}

Regret is less of an issue when\nconsequences cannot be tied back to a particular risk exposure or a particular\ndecision maker.\nThe valuation of a risk is likely to depend on how the risk is generated. We\ntolerate voluntarily assumed risks more than those, such as environmental hazards,\nover which we have no control. We regard acts of commission as much more serious\nthan acts of omission. In pharmaceutical screening, for example, the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) worries more about introducing harmful new drugs than\nabout missing opportunities for risk reduction offered by new pharmaceutical prod-\nucts.17\nAgency Dilemmas\nProblems of risk perception and valuation may become entangled with so-called\nagency problems. What rules apply when one individual or organization (the agent)\nmakes risk decisions on behalf of another (the principal)? Should the agent replicate\nshortcomings in the principal's decision-making capabilities? Suppose there is one\nchance in 10,000 that a drug will have adverse consequences as severe as those of\nthalidomide. If the drug offers significant health benefits, it may be best for society\nto permit this risk-particularly since approving the drug would generate informa-\ntion useful in risk assessment, and the decision could be reversed if appropriate. Yet\nin practice, the FDA (society's agent) would probably not make such a decision,\nbecause of its bias toward avoiding new risks.18\nSociety's pattern of lopsided tradeoffs between errors of omission and commis-\nsion persists for at least two reasons. First, apart from people's levels of risk, their\nconsumption of information is relevant. When a federal agency demonstrates that it\nwill not take chances with individual health, that reassurance alone enhances indi-\nvidual welfare. Conversely, a perception that the government tolerates risks to the\npublic might be more damaging than the risks themselves. Second, it is easier to\nobserve the costs of bad drugs that are approved than to assess the foregone benefits\nof good drugs that were not introduced. (Note, however, that potential beneficiaries,\nsuch as the users of saccharin and AIDS victims, sometimes put substantial pressure\non the FDA to compromise normally stringent procedures for approving food addi-\ntives and drugs.)19\nHow should we proceed once we admit that individuals do not react to many risks\n"correctly"? We might ask the government to make many more decisions. It is not\nclear, however, that the government itself is well equipped to compute certain risks\naccurately or to make sensible decisions once that information is obtained. Alter-\nnatively, we could shift decision-making authority to those best qualified to make\nparticular kinds of choices. Here, however, the problem arises that the preferences\nof those making a decision might not be the same as those affected by it. A third\npossibility would be to develop processes enabling both agents and principals to\nparticipate in risk-related decisions, but there is little evidence that such processes\nwould produce convergence. Finally, we might try to improve individuals' decision\nmaking skills by providing them, for example, with expert-certified information,\nmuch as accounting firms verify the accuracy of reported financial data.\nTI\nSc\nci\nfro\nth\nth\nth\n4:\nda\naş\npe\nat\nb\nn\nto\nti\nd\nc\na\np\nC\nn\n上\nF\nt\n(\nt\n(\n:	4	{"length": 3409, "index": 4}

With respect to\ncigarette smoking, for example, this may not be the same thing as seeking a smoke-\nfree society. (Note that research linking aflatoxin and cancer risks20 has not moved\nthe Surgeon General to call for a peanut butter-free society.) Politically, of course,\nthe passive smoking concern may be a trump card, rendering it irrelevant whether\nthe risk imposed on others is substantial or negligible.\nHazard warnings are often used to convey risk information. Congress has man-\ndated labels for cigarettes, artificial sweeteners, and alcoholic beverages. Federal\nagencies impose labeling requirements for consumer products, workplace risks, and\npesticides. Informational efforts work in conjunction with market forces rather than\nattempting to supersede them.\nIndividuals may have difficulty processing risk information, however. 21 Overam-\nbitious information efforts may outstrip decision-making capabilities (e.g., Califor-\nnia Proposition 65,22 which requires warnings for products that expose consumers\nto annual risks of cancer of 1 in 7 million). The dangers are underreaction, overreac-\ntion, and nonreaction-a complete dismissal of the risk information effort. Sound\ndecisions are unlikely to result. Indeed, the supposition of informed consent is\ncalled into question.\nMore general human cognitive limitations also work against detailed information-\nal efforts. If a warning label contains more than a handful of items, or if warnings\nproliferate, problems of information overload arise: 23\nIn a democratic society, one should hesitate to override the legitimate preferences\nof segments of the population, taking care not to dismiss diversity of taste as mere\nnonrational choice. Where there is broad consensus on a rational course of action,\nhowever, and either the cost of providing information is high or individuals cannot\nprocess the information adequately, then mandatory requirements may be preferable\nto risk information efforts. Laws requiring the use of seat belts are one possible\nexample.\nIndividuals often fail to interpret risks or value their consequences accurately.\nGovernment efforts may escape some of these biases but are often thrown off course\nby political pressures and agency losses. The consequence is that our risk portfolio\nenjoys no legitimacy and satisfies no one. The first step toward a remedy is to\ndevelop a broad-based understanding of the nature of risk.\n9.3 REASON AND INFORMATION ABOUT RISK\nInformation on risk is generated through several mechanisms. The most salient\nsource is scientific research, but information can also be gained through experience,\nand knowledge of such information can be increased by distributing it more widely.\nRisk, Uncertainty, and Ignorance\nIt is helpful to distinguish among risk, uncertainty, and ignorance. In the situation of\nrisk, we know the states of the world that may prevail (a flipped coin will show one	5	{"length": 3274, "index": 5}

For one-time-\nonly decisions, from the standpoint of Bayesian decision making, the mean assess-\nment of the probability of each outcome is all that matters, for that gives the\nlikelihood with which the outcome will be received. For example, with option I\nthere is a 10 percent chance that a 0.01 risk is imposed and a 90 percent chance that\nno risk is imposed. With option II, there is a 100 percent chance of a 0.002 risk.\nOption I should be preferred since its mean risk, 0.1 × 0.01 + 0.9 × 0 = 0.001, is\nlower than for option II.28\nIn situations of learning and sequential decisions, the precision of the estimate\nalso matters. Paradoxically, imprecisely known probabilities are more favorable, as\nsome simple examples illustrate. Suppose you must choose between two alternative\nmedical treatments. Choice A is known to cure half the patients to whom it is\napplied. Choice B is an experimental treatment that is equally likely to be either\nperfect or worthless. In each case, the probability of a cure is 0.5. On a one-time-\nout basis the two options are equally attractive.\nWith two patients in sequential trials, however, the correct strategy is to pursue\nB. If the first patient recovers, give the second the same treatment; otherwise switch\nto A. With this strategy, on average one and one-fourth of two patients will recover,\nas opposed to only one out of two if the better-known treatment A is chosen at the\noutset. (This is equivalent to the simplest version of the classic two-armed bandit\nproblem.)29 In any choice between a certain and an uncertain risk of an adverse\noutcome, if the initial mean value for the probability is the same, the uncertain risk\nis preferable when learning and adaptive behavior after experience are possible.\nNow suppose the experimental treatment is treatment C, which will turn out to be\neither a total failure or a 90 percent cure (with both possibilities equally likely).\nTrying C rather than A will be preferable (offering an expected 1.13 cures), 30 but\nnow the first patient will face unfavorable odds with experimental treatment C (0.45\nrather than 0.5 with A). If randomization is not possible, or if the first patient\nobjects, perhaps even after a lottery is conducted, ethical norms would require\noffering the patient treatment A. This argument has been illogically extended to\nsuggest that even if experimental treatment C looks better than established treatment\nA. we may find out it was worse, and we should therefore stick with A. In the\nmedical context, patient interest provides an antidote to such misconceptions. Many\nexperimental technologies are not blessed with such a counterweight.\nRegulatory Efforts and Misplaced Conservatism\nGovernment efforts at developing risk information are not guided by the formal\nstatistical properties of the risk but rather by administrative procedures incorporat-\ning various types of "conservatism." Although risk-assessment biases may operate\nin both directions, 31 most approved procedures tend to overstate the actual risk. 32 In\nregulating toxic substances, for example, results from the most sensitive animal\nspecies are often used, and government agencies such as the EPA routinely focus on\nthe upper end of the 95 percent confidence interval as the risk level rather than use\nthe mean of the distribution. A series of such conservative assumptions (e.g., on	6	{"length": 3481, "index": 6}

In this\nassignment, we'll implement a byte-level BPE tokenizer, where the vocabulary items are bytes or merged\nsequences of bytes, which give us the best of both worlds in terms of out-of-vocabulary handling and man-\nageable input sequence lengths.. The process of constructing the BPE tokenizer vocabulary is known as\n"training" the BPE tokenizer.\n4 2.4 BPE Tokenizer Training\nThe BPE tokenizer training procedure consists of three main steps.\nVocabulary initialization.. The tokenizer vocabulary is a one-to-one mapping from string token to integer\nID.. Since we're training a byte-level BPE tokenizer, our initial vocabulary is simply the set of all bytes.. Since\nthere are 256 possible byte values, our initial vocabulary is of size 256.\nPre-tokenization.. Once you have a vocabulary, you could, in principle, count how often bytes occur next\nto each other in your text and begin merging them starting with the most frequent pair of bytes.. However,\nthis is quite computationally expensive, since we'd have to go take a full pass over the corpus each time\nwe merge.. In addition, directly merging bytes across the corpus may result in tokens that differ only in\npunctuation (e.g., dog!. vs.. dog.).. These tokens would get completely different token IDs, even though they\nare likely to have high semantic similarity (since they differ only in punctuation).\nTo avoid this, we pre-tokenize the corpus.. You can think of this as a coarse-grained tokenization over the\ncorpus that helps us count how often pairs of characters appear.. For example, the word 'text' might be\na pre-token that appears 10 times.. In this case, when we count how often the characters 't' and 'e' appear\nnext to each other, we will see that the word 'text' has 't' and 'e' adjacent and we can increment their count\nby 10 instead of looking through the corpus.. Since we're training a byte-level BPE model, each pre-token is\nrepresented as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.\nThe original BPE implementation of Sennrich et al.. [2016] pre-tokenizes by simply splitting on whitespace\n(i.e., s.split(" "))..	4	{"length": 2373, "index": 4}

Now that we've converted our input text into pre-tokens and represented each\npre-token as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, we can compute the BPE merges (i.e., train the BPE tokenizer).\nAt a high level, the BPE algorithm iteratively counts every pair of bytes and identifies the pair with the\nhighest frequency (“A”, “B”).. Every occurrence of this most frequent pair (“A”, “B”) is then merged, i.e.,\nreplaced with a new token "AB".. This new merged token is added to our vocabulary; as a result, the final\nvocabulary after BPE training is the size of the initial vocabulary (256 in our case), plus the number of BPE\nmerge operations used for training.. For efficiency during BPE training, we do not consider pairs that cross\npre-token boundaries.2 When computing merges, deterministically break ties in pair frequency by preferring\nthe lexicographically greater pair.. For example, if the pairs ("A”, “B”), (“А”, “C”), (“B”, “ZZ”), and (“BA",\n"A") all have the highest frequency, we'd merge (“BA”, “A”):\n>>> max([("A", "B"), ("A", "C"), ("B", "ZZ"), ("BA", "A")])\n('BA', 'A')\n2Note that the original BPE formulation [Sennrich et al., 2016] specifies the inclusion of an end-of-word token.. We do not\nadd an end-of-word-token when training byte-level BPE models because all bytes (including whitespace and punctuation) are\nincluded in the model's vocabulary.. Since we're explicitly representing spaces and punctuation, the learned BPE merges will\nnaturally reflect these word boundaries.\n5 Special tokens.. Often, some strings (e.g., <. endoftext. >) are used to encode metadata (e.g., boundaries\nbetween documents).. When encoding text, it's often desirable to treat some strings as "special tokens" that\nshould never be split into multiple tokens (i.e., will always be preserved as a single token).. For example,\nthe end-of-sequence string <. endoftext.	5	{"length": 2396, "index": 5}

These special tokens must be added to\nthe vocabulary, so they have a corresponding fixed token ID.\nAlgorithm 1 of Sennrich et al.. [2016] contains a inefficient implementation of BPE tokenizer training\n(essentially following the steps that we outlined above).. As a first exercise, it may be useful to implement\nand test this function to test your understanding.\nExample (bpe_example): BPE training example\nHere is a stylized example from Sennrich et al.. [2016].. Consider a corpus consisting of the following text\nlow low low low low\nlower lower widest widest widest\nnewest newest newest newest newest newest\nand the vocabulary has a special token <. endoftext. >.\nVocabulary We initialize our vocabulary with our special token <. endoftext. > and the 256 byte\nvalues.\nPre-tokenization When we pretokenize and count, we end up with the frequency table.\n{low: 5, lower: 2, widest: 3, newest:6}\nIt is often convenient to represent this as a dict [tuple [byte]: int], e.g.. {(1,0,w):5 ...}\nMerges We first look at every successive pair of bytes and sum the frequency of the words where they\nappear {10: 7, ow: 7, we: 8, er: 2, wi: 3, id: 3, de: 3, es: 9, st: 9, ne: 6, ew: 6}.. The pair ('es')\nand ('st') are tied, so we take the lexicographically greater pair, ('st').. We would then merge the\npre-tokens so that we end up with {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,e,st):3, (n,e,w,e,st):6}.\nIn the second round, we see that (e, st) is the most common pair (with a count of 9) and we\nwould merge into {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,est):3, (n,e,w,est):6}.. Continuing this, the\nsequence of merges we get in the end will be ['st', 'e st', 'o w', 'l ow', 'w est', 'n e',\n'ne west', 'w i', 'wi d', 'wid est', 'low e', 'lowe r'].\nIf we take 6 merges, we have ['s t', 'e st', 'o w', '1 ow', 'w est', 'n e' and our vocab-\nulary elements would be [<. endoftext. >, [...256 BYTE CHARS], st, est, ow, low, west, ne].\nWith this vocabulary and set of merges, the word newest would tokenize as [ne, west].\nThis naïve implementation of BPE training is slow because for every merge, it iterates over all byte pairs\nto identify the most frequent pair.. However, the only pair counts that change after each merge are those\nthat overlap with the merged pair..	6	{"length": 2378, "index": 6}

In fact, conservatism of this nature is undesirable for three reasons.\nFirst, these conservative biases often are not uniform across risks, so that compara-\ntive risk judgments may be in error. If we focus on reducing risks for which standard\nerrors are large with respect to their level, then we will save fewer expected lives\nthan if we were guided by the mean of our probability distribution on the risk level.\nIn effect, society will be curtailing the wrong risks, ones that offer less expected\nhealth improvement than other available options, for the resources and benefits\nforegone. The bias that results will cut against new technologies and innovative\nproducts. Second, stringent regulation of uncertain risks destroys opportunities for\nlearning, ignoring the lesson of the medical treatment example above. Third and\nmost fundamental, tilting risk assessments in a conservative direction confuses the\ninformational and decision aspects of research about risks. A conceptually sound\nform of conservatism would have the decision maker (not the risk estimator) adjust\nthe weights on the consequences. Adjusting the probabilities amounts to lying to\nourselves about what we expect.\n9.4 TOWARD REASONABLE POLICIES TOWARD RISK\nRestrictions on a risky activity, such as exposure limits or restrictions in use, should\nbe based on the relative gains and losses of the activity as compared with its\nalternatives. In thinking about these tradeoffs, one should remember that improve-\nments in mortality and morbidity have come primarily from technological progress\nand a higher standard of living, not from government regulation or private for-\nbearance. 33 A dramatic case in point is that of postwar Japan, where mortality rates\nhave fallen for all age groups. Over the period 1955-1975, with a rapid rise in the\nstandard of living, mortality rates for men aged 65-69 fell 32 percent; men aged\n25-29 had a 64 percent drop. 34 Sustained economic development also seems to be\nthe principal factor in explaining mortality gains in the United States. In contrast,\nrisk-regulation policies often provide few major dividends. 35\nIt is useful to think about risk-averting policy in terms of the rates of tradeoff\ninvolved, such as the cost per expected life saved. Using this lives-saved standard of\nvalue highlights the most effective means of promoting our risk reduction objec-\ntive. 36 The cost-effectiveness of existing regulations ranges widely, from $200,000\nper life saved for airplane cabin fire protection to as much as $132 million per life\nsaved for a 1979 regulation of DES in cattle feed. 37 These wide discrepancies reflect\ndifferences among agencies in their risk-cost balancing as well as differences in the\ncharacter of risk-reducing opportunities. The Federal Aviation Administration has\ntraditionally undervalued lives, looking only at lost earnings, whereas food additive\nregulations and EPA ambient air quality standards are set without consideration of\ncost. Elimination of such interagency imbalances would foster better control of risks\nat less cost.\nThe fundamental policy question is how far to proceed with lifesaving expendi-	7	{"length": 3414, "index": 7}

Now, we will implement a BPE tokenizer that\nloads a provided vocabulary and list of merges and uses them to encode and decode text to/from token IDs.\n2.6.1 Encoding text\nThe process of encoding text by BPE mirrors how we train the BPE vocabulary.. There are a few major\nsteps.\nStep 1: Pre-tokenize.. We first pre-tokenize the sequence and represent each pre-token as a sequence of\nUTF-8 bytes, just as we did in BPE training.. We will be merging these bytes within each pre-token into\nvocabulary elements.\nStep 2: Apply the merges.. We then take the sequence of vocabulary element merges created during BPE\ntraining, and apply it to our pre-tokens in the same order of creation.\nExample (bpe_encoding): BPE encoding example\nFor example, suppose our input string is 'the cat ate', our vocabulary is {0:\nb' ', 1: b'a',\nb'the', 10: b'\n(b'th', b'e'),\n2: b'c', 3: b'e', 4: b'h', 5: b't', 6: b'th', 7: b'c', 8: b'a', 9:\nat'}, and our learned merges are [(b't', b'h'), (' ', b'c'), (b' ', 'a'),\n(b' a', b't')].. First, our pre-tokenizer would split this string into ['the', 'cat', 'ate'].\nThen, we'll look at each pre-token and apply the BPE merges.\nThe first pre-token 'the' is initially represented as [b't', b'h', b'e'].. Looking at our list of\nmerges, we identify the first applicable merge to be (b't', b'h'), and use that the transform the\npre-token into [b'th', b'e']..	8	{"length": 2425, "index": 8}

Finally, looking back at\nthe list of merges, we see that there are no more that apply to the string (since the entire pre-token has\nbeen merged into a single token), so we are done applying the BPE merges.. The corresponding integer\nsequence is [9].\nRepeating this process for the remaining pre-tokens, we see that the pre-token 'cat' is represented\nas [b'c', b'a', b't'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the integer sequence [7, 1,\n5].. The final pre-token 'ate' is [b' at', b'e'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the\ninteger sequence [10, 3].. Thus, the final result of encoding our input string is [9, 7, 1, 5, 10,\n3].\nSpecial tokens.. Your tokenizer should be able to properly handle user-defined special tokens when en-\ncoding text (provided when constructing the tokenizer).\nMemory considerations.. Suppose we want to tokenize a large text file that we cannot fit in memory.\nTo efficiently tokenize this large file (or any other stream of data), we need to break it up into manageable\nchunks and process each chunk in-turn, so that the memory complexity is constant as opposed to linear in\nthe size of the text.. In doing so, we need to make sure that a token doesn't cross chunk boundaries, else\nwe'll get a different tokenization than the naïve method of tokenizing the entire sequence in-memory.\n8.	9	{"length": 1477, "index": 9}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be\nchanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are\nmore disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to\nwhich they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the\nsame object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to\nthrow off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the\npatient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their\nformer systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated\ninjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these\nstates. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended\nin their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended he has utterly neglected to\nattend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those\npeople would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them, and\nformidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the\ndepository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his\nmeasures.\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on\nthe rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the\nlegislative powers, incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the\nstate remaining in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions\nwithin.\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for\nnaturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others, to encourage their migration hither, and raising the\nconditions of new appropriations of lands.\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing\njudiciary powers.\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and\npayment of their salaries.	0	{"length": 3837, "index": 0}

A prince, whose character is thus\nmarked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to\ntime, of attempts by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have\nreminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their\nnative justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to\ndisavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.\nThey, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice, and of consanguinity.

He works in other strata of the psyche and has little to do\nwith the emotional impulses that provide the usual subject matter\nof aesthetics, impulses that are restrained, inhibited in their aims\nand dependent on numerous attendant circumstances. Yet now and\nthen it happens that he has to take an interest in a particular area of\naesthetics, and then it is usually a marginal one that has been\nneglected in the specialist literature.\nOne such is the 'uncanny'. There is no doubt that this belongs to\nthe realm of the frightening, of what evokes fear and dread. It is\nequally beyond doubt that the word is not always used in a clearly\ndefinable sense, and so it commonly merges with what arouses\nfear in general. Yet one may presume that there exists a specific\naffective nucleus, which justifies the use of a special conceptual\nterm. One would like to know the nature of this common nucleus,\nwhich allows us to distinguish the 'uncanny' within the field of the\nfrightening.\nOn this topic we find virtually nothing in the detailed accounts of\naesthetics, which on the whole prefer to concern themselves with\nour feelings for the beautiful, the grandiose and the attractive – that\nis to say, with feelings of a positive kind, their determinants and the\nobjects that arouse them - rather than with their opposites, feelings\nof repulsion and distress. In the medico-psychological literature I\nknow only one study on the subject, that of E. Jentsch;¹ and this,\nwhile rich in content, is not exhaustive. True, I have to own that, for\n123	1	{"length": 1746, "index": 1}

Indeed, the present writer must\nplead guilty to exceptional obtuseness in this regard, when great\ndelicacy of feeling would be more appropriate. It is a long time since\nhe experienced or became acquainted with anything that conveyed\nthe impression of the uncanny. He must first put himself in the\nproper state of feeling and so put himself in the way of experiencing\na sense of the uncanny. Yet such difficulties play an important part\nin other areas of aesthetics too; hence one need not, for that reason,\ngive up hope of finding cases in which the feeling in question will\nbe unequivocally acknowledged by most people.\nThere are thus two courses open to us: either we can investigate\nthe semantic content that has accrued to the German word unheim-\nlich [of which the nearest semantic equivalents in English are\n'uncanny' and 'eerie', but which etymologically corresponds to\n'unhomely'] as the language has developed, or we can assemble\nwhatever it is about persons and things, sense impressions, experi-\nences and situations, that evokes in us a sense of the uncanny, and\nthen go on to infer its hidden nature from what all these have in\ncommon. I can say in advance that both these courses lead to the\nsame conclusion – that the uncanny is that species of the frightening\nthat goes back to what was once well known and had long been\nfamiliar. How this can be – under what conditions the familiar can\nbecome uncanny and frightening - will emerge in what follows. I\nmust add that the present study actually began with a collection of\nindividual cases and that the findings were only later corroborated\nby what we are told by [German] linguistic usage, but here I shall\nwork in reverse order.\nUnheimlich is clearly the opposite of heimlich, heimisch, ver-\ntraut, and it seems obvious that something should be frightening\n124\n:\nI The Uncanny\nprecisely because it is unknown and unfamiliar. But of course the\nconverse is not true: not everything new and unfamiliar is frighten-\ning. All one can say is that what is novel may well prove frightening\nand uncanny; some things that are novel are indeed frightening, but\nby no means all. Something must be added to the novel and the\nunfamiliar if it is to become uncanny.\nOn the whole Jentsch does not go beyond relating the uncanny\nto the novel and the unfamiliar. For him the essential condition for\nthe emergence of a sense of the uncanny is intellectual uncertainty.\nOne would suppose, then, that the uncanny would always be an area\nin which a person was unsure of his way around: the better oriented\nhe was in the world around him, the less likely he would be to find\nthe objects and occurrences in it uncanny.\nThis definition is clearly not exhaustive. We will therefore try to\ngo beyond a mere equation of the uncanny with the unfamiliar and\nturn first to other languages. But the dictionaries we consult tell us\nnothing new, if only perhaps because we ourselves speak a foreign\nlanguage. Indeed, we gain the impression that many languages lack\na word for this particular species of the frightening.3\nLATIN (K. E. Georges, Kleines Deutsch-Lateinisches Wörter-\nbuch 1898): 'ein unheimlicher Ort' ['an eerie place'] – locus sus-\npectus; 'in unheimlicher Nachtzeit' ['in the eerie night hours']\nintempesta nocte.\nGREEK (from the dictionaries of Rost and Schenkl): xénos,\n'foreign, alien'.\nENGLISH (from the dictionaries of Lucas, Bellows, Flügel and\nMuret-Sanders): uncomfortable, uneasy, gloomy, dismal, uncanny,\nghastly, (of a house): haunted, (of a person): a repulsive fellow.\naise.\nFRENCH (Sachs-Villatte): inquiétant, sinistre, lugubre, mal à son\nSPANISH (Tollhausen 1889): sospechoso, de mal aguero, lúgubre,\nsiniestro.\nItalian and Portuguese seem to make do with words that we\nwould call periphrases.

As witness the passage from Gutzkow: 'We call that\nunheimlich; you call it heimlich. This reminds us that this word\nheimlich is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which\nare not mutually contradictory, but very different from each other -\nthe one relating to what is familiar and comfortable, the other to\nwhat is concealed and kept hidden. Unheimlich is the antonym of\nheimlich only in the latter's first sense, not in its second. Sanders\nsuggests no genetic connection between the two senses. On the\nother hand, our attention is seized by Schelling's remark, which says\nsomething quite new - something we certainly did not expect -\nabout the meaning of unheimlich, namely, that the term 'uncanny'\n(unheimlich) applies to everything that was intended to remain\nsecret, hidden away, and has come into the open.\nSome of the doubts that arise here are cleared up by the data in\nthe German Dictionary of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (Deutsches\nWörterbuch, Leipzig 1877, IV/2, 873ff.):\n132\nI The Uncanny\nHeimlich: adj. and adv. vernaculus, occultus: Middle High German\nheimelîch, heimlich.\np. 874: In a somewhat different sense: es ist mir heimlich, 'I feel\nwell, free from fear', [3] b) heimlich is also used of a place that is\nfree of ghostly influences...\np. 875: B) familiar; friendly, confiding.\n4. Starting from the homely and the domestic, there is a\nfurther development towards the notion of something\nremoved from the eyes of strangers, hidden, secret. This\nnotion is extended in a number of ways...\np. 876:\nlinks am see\nliegt eine matte heimlich im gehölz\nSchiller, Wilhelm Tell I, 4\n(To the left by the lake\nlies a meadow hidden among the trees.)\nUncommon in modern usage is the combination of heimlich with\na verb denoting concealment: Er verbirgt mich heimlich in seinem\ngezelt (Psalm 27, 5), [AV: 'In the secret of his tabernacle shall he\nhide me']. Secret places on the human body, the pudenda: welche\nLeute nicht sturben, die wurden geschlagen an heimlichen örten,\nI Samuel 5, 12: "Those who did not die were smitten in secret places',\n[AV: 'And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods'].\nc) Officials who dispense important advice on affairs of state that\nis to be kept secret are called heimliche räthe ('privy councillors');\nin modern usage the adjective is replaced by geheim (q.v.): Pharao\nnennet ihn (Joseph) den heimlichen rath, 'Pharaoh named him the\nprivy councillor', Gen. 41, 45;\np. 878: 6. heimlich as used of knowledge, mystical, allegorical:\nheimliche bedeutung ('secret meaning'), mysticus, divinus, occultus,\nfiguratus.\np. 878: in the following heimlich is used differently for what is\nwithdrawn from knowledge, unconscious...\nbut then heimlich also means 'locked away, inscrutable':...\n133	6	{"length": 3929, "index": 6}

They do not trust us,\nthey fear the inscrutable face of the\nFriedländer [i.e. Wallenstein].)\n9. The notion of the hidden and the dangerous, which\nappears in the last section, undergoes a further development,\nso that heimlich acquires the sense that otherwise belongs to\nunheimlich (formed from heimlich, 3 b, col. 874: mir ist zu zeiten\nwie dem menschen der in nacht wandelt und an gespenster glaubt,\njeder winkel ist ihm heimlich und schauerhaft, 'I sometimes feel like\na sleepwalker who believes in ghosts: every corner seems to him\neerie and frightening'), Klinger, Theater, 3, 298.\nHeimlich thus becomes increasingly ambivalent, until it finally\nmerges with its antonym unheimlich. The uncanny (das Unheim-\nliche, 'the unhomely') is in some way a species of the familiar (das\nHeimliche, 'the homely'). Let us relate this finding, which still has\nto be explained, to Schelling's definition of the uncanny. Separate\ninvestigations of cases of the uncanny will enable us to make sense\nof these hints.\n134\nII\nIf we now go on to review the persons and things, the impressions,\nprocesses and situations that can arouse an especially strong and\ndistinct sense of the uncanny in us, we must clearly choose an\nappropriate example to start with. E. Jentsch singles out, as an\nexcellent case, 'doubt as to whether an apparently animate object\nreally is alive and, conversely, whether a lifeless object might not\nperhaps be animate'. In this connection he refers to the impressions\nmade on us by waxwork figures, ingeniously constructed dolls and\nautomata. To these he adds the uncanny effect produced by epileptic\nfits and the manifestations of insanity, because these arouse in the\nonlooker vague notions of automatic – mechanical - processes that\nmay lie hidden behind the familiar image of a living person. Now,\nwhile not wholly convinced by the author's arguments, we will take\nthem as a starting point for our own investigation, because he goes\non to remind us of one writer who was more successful than any\nother at creating uncanny effects.\n'One of the surest devices for producing slightly uncanny effects\nthrough story-telling,' writes Jentsch, 'is to leave the reader wonder-\ning whether a particular figure is a real person or an automaton, and\nto do so in such a way that his attention is not focused directly on\nthe uncertainty, lest he should be prompted to examine and settle\nthe matter at once, for in this way, as we have said, the special\nemotional effect can easily be dissipated. E. T. A. Hoffmann often\nemployed this psychological manoeuvre with success in his imaginat-\nive writings.'\nThis observation, which is undoubtedly correct, refers in particu-\nlar to Hoffmann's story "The Sand-Man', one of the 'Night Pieces'\n135	7	{"length": 2881, "index": 7}

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face!

Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness. In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of it. In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination, and volition.[2] Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling, or perception. It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, metacognition, or self-awareness, either continuously changing or not.[3][4] The disparate range of research, notions, and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked.[5]\n\nExamples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: ordered distinction between self and environment, simple wakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by "looking within"; being a metaphorical "stream" of contents, or being a mental state, mental event, or mental process of the brain.\n\nEtymology [ edit ]\n\nThe words "conscious" and "consciousness" in the English language date to the 17th century, and the first recorded use of "conscious" as a simple adjective was applied figuratively to inanimate objects ("the conscious Groves", 1643).[6]: 175 It derived from the Latin conscius (con- "together" and scio "to know") which meant "knowing with" or "having joint or common knowledge with another", especially as in sharing a secret.[7] Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan (1651) wrote: "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another".[8] There were also many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as "knowing with oneself", or in other words "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". This phrase has the figurative sense of "knowing that one knows", which is something like the modern English word "conscious", but it was rendered into English as "conscious to oneself" or "conscious unto oneself". For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness".[9]	0	{"length": 2492, "index": 0}

It means a kind of shared knowledge with moral value, specifically what a witness knows of someone else's deeds.[10][11] Although René Descartes (1596–1650), writing in Latin, is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way less like the traditional meaning and more like the way modern English speakers would use "conscience", his meaning is nowhere defined.[12] In Search after Truth (Regulæ ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale, Amsterdam 1701) he wrote the word with a gloss: conscientiâ, vel interno testimonio (translatable as "conscience, or internal testimony").[13][14] It might mean the knowledge of the value of one's own thoughts.[12]\n\nThe origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to John Locke who defined the word in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1690, as "the perception of what passes in a man's own mind".[15][16] The essay strongly influenced 18th-century British philosophy, and Locke's definition appeared in Samuel Johnson's celebrated Dictionary (1755).[17]\n\nThe French term conscience is defined roughly like English "consciousness" in the 1753 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie as "the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do".[18]\n\nProblem of definition [ edit ]\n\nAbout forty meanings attributed to the term consciousness can be identified and categorized based on functions and experiences. The prospects for reaching any single, agreed-upon, theory-independent definition of consciousness appear remote.[19]\n\nScholars are divided as to whether Aristotle had a concept of consciousness. He does not use any single word or terminology that is clearly similar to the phenomenon or concept defined by John Locke. Victor Caston contends that Aristotle did have a concept more clearly similar to perception.[20]\n\nModern dictionary definitions of the word consciousness evolved over several centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings, with some differences that have been controversial, such as the distinction between inward awareness and perception of the physical world, or the distinction between conscious and unconscious, or the notion of a mental entity or mental activity that is not physical.	1	{"length": 2405, "index": 1}

Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial. [ 23 ]\n\nTraditional metaphors for mind [ edit ]\n\nDuring the early 19th century, the emerging field of geology inspired a popular metaphor that the mind likewise had hidden layers "which recorded the past of the individual".[24]: 3 By 1875, most psychologists believed that "consciousness was but a small part of mental life",[24]: 3 and this idea underlies the goal of Freudian therapy, to expose the unconscious layer of the mind.\n\nOther metaphors from various sciences inspired other analyses of the mind, for example: Johann Friedrich Herbart described ideas as being attracted and repulsed like magnets; John Stuart Mill developed the idea of "mental chemistry" and "mental compounds", and Edward B. Titchener sought the "structure" of the mind by analyzing its "elements". The abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states of matter.\n\nIn 1892, William James noted that the "ambiguous word 'content' has been recently invented instead of 'object'" and that the metaphor of mind as a container seemed to minimize the dualistic problem of how "states of consciousness can know" things, or objects;[25]: 465 by 1899 psychologists were busily studying the "contents of conscious experience by introspection and experiment".[26]: 365 Another popular metaphor was James's doctrine of the stream of consciousness, with continuity, fringes, and transitions.[25]: vii [a]	3	{"length": 2349, "index": 3}

Prime examples were phrases like inner experience and personal consciousness:\n\nThe first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experience is the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on. 'States of mind' succeed each other in him. [...] But everyone knows what the terms mean [only] in a rough way; [...] When I say every 'state' or 'thought' is part of a personal consciousness, 'personal consciousness' is one of the terms in question. Its meaning we know so long as no one asks us to define it, but to give an accurate account of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks. [...] The only states of consciousness that we naturally deal with are found in personal consciousnesses, minds, selves, concrete particular I's and you's. [25]: 152–153\n\nFrom introspection to awareness [ edit ]\n\nPrior to the 20th century, philosophers treated the phenomenon of consciousness as the "inner world [of] one's own mind", and introspection was the mind "attending to" itself,[b] an activity seemingly distinct from that of perceiving the 'outer world' and its physical phenomena. In 1892 William James noted the distinction along with doubts about the inward character of the mind:\n\n'Things' have been doubted, but thoughts and feelings have never been doubted. The outer world, but never the inner world, has been denied. Everyone assumes that we have direct introspective acquaintance with our thinking activity as such, with our consciousness as something inward and contrasted with the outer objects which it knows. Yet I must confess that for my part I cannot feel sure of this conclusion. [...] It seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a postulate than a sensibly given fact...[25]: 467\n\nBy the 1960s, for many philosophers and psychologists who talked about consciousness, the word no longer meant the 'inner world' but an indefinite, large category called awareness, as in the following example:	4	{"length": 2192, "index": 4}

The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means. Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness—to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.[29]\n\nUsing 'awareness', however, as a definition or synonym of consciousness is not a simple matter:\n\nIf awareness of the environment . . . is the criterion of consciousness, then even the protozoans are conscious. If awareness of awareness is required, then it is doubtful whether the great apes and human infants are conscious.[26]\n\nInfluence on research [ edit ]\n\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood by the majority of people despite the difficulty philosophers have had defining it.[30] Max Velmans proposed that the "everyday understanding of consciousness" uncontroversially "refers to experience itself rather than any particular thing that we observe or experience" and he added that consciousness "is [therefore] exemplified by all the things that we observe or experience",[31]: 4 whether thoughts, feelings, or perceptions. Velmans noted however, as of 2009, that there was a deep level of "confusion and internal division"[31] among experts about the phenomenon of consciousness, because researchers lacked "a sufficiently well-specified use of the term...to agree that they are investigating the same thing".[31]: 3 He argued additionally that "pre-existing theoretical commitments" to competing explanations of consciousness might be a source of bias.	5	{"length": 2495, "index": 5}

With advances in brain research, "the presence or absence of experienced phenomena"[31]: 3 of any kind underlies the work of those neuroscientists who seek "to analyze the precise relation of conscious phenomenology to its associated information processing" in the brain.[31]: 10 This neuroscientific goal is to find the "neural correlates of consciousness" (NCC). One criticism of this goal is that it begins with a theoretical commitment to the neurological origin of all "experienced phenomena" whether inner or outer.[c] Also, the fact that the easiest 'content of consciousness' to be so analyzed is "the experienced three-dimensional world (the phenomenal world) beyond the body surface"[31]: 4 invites another criticism, that most consciousness research since the 1990s, perhaps because of bias, has focused on processes of external perception.[33]\n\nFrom a history of psychology perspective, Julian Jaynes rejected popular but "superficial views of consciousness"[2]: 447 especially those which equate it with "that vaguest of terms, experience".[24]: 8 In 1976 he insisted that if not for introspection, which for decades had been ignored or taken for granted rather than explained, there could be no "conception of what consciousness is"[24]: 18 and in 1990, he reaffirmed the traditional idea of the phenomenon called 'consciousness', writing that "its denotative definition is, as it was for René Descartes, John Locke, and David Hume, what is introspectable".[2]: 450 Jaynes saw consciousness as an important but small part of human mentality, and he asserted: "there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until ... what is introspectable [is] sharply distinguished"[2]: 447 from the unconscious processes of cognition such as perception, reactive awareness and attention, and automatic forms of learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.[24]: 21-47	6	{"length": 2142, "index": 6}

For some researchers, consciousness is linked to some kind of "selfhood", for example to certain pragmatic issues such as the feeling of agency and the effects of regret[33] and action on experience of one's own body or social identity.[35] Similarly Daniel Kahneman, who focused on systematic errors in perception, memory and decision-making, has differentiated between two kinds of mental processes, or cognitive "systems":[36] the "fast" activities that are primary, automatic and "cannot be turned off",[36]: 22 and the "slow", deliberate, effortful activities of a secondary system "often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration".[36]: 13 Kahneman's two systems have been described as "roughly corresponding to unconscious and conscious processes".[37]: 8 The two systems can interact, for example in sharing the control of attention.[36]: 22 While System 1 can be impulsive, "System 2 is in charge of self-control",[36]: 26 and "When we think of ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do".[36]: 21\n\nSome have argued that we should eliminate the concept from our understanding of the mind, a position known as consciousness semanticism.[38]\n\nIn medicine, a "level of consciousness" terminology is used to describe a patient's arousal and responsiveness, which can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli.[39] Issues of practical concern include how the level of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted.[40] The degree or level of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior observation scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy of mind [ edit ]	7	{"length": 2259, "index": 7}

An alternative is to focus primarily on current philosophical stances and empirical findings.\n\nCoherence of the concept [ edit ]\n\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.[42] While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,[30] skeptics argue that this intuition is too narrow, either because the concept of consciousness is embedded in our intuitions, or because we all are illusions. Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of entities, or identities, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of "consciousness" we end up leading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.[43]\n\nTypes [ edit ]	8	{"length": 1363, "index": 8}

These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the past is access conscious, and so on. Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction,[45] others have broadly accepted it. David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.[46]\n\nSome philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story. William Lycan, for example, argued in his book Consciousness and Experience that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness of; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)—and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.[47]\n\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately. Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block, for instance, suggests the case of a "zombie" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding "I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility".[48]\n\nDistinguishing consciousness from its contents [ edit ]	9	{"length": 2351, "index": 9}

This bird's name is Of a Flock (peng 鵬), yet its back is countless thousands of miles across and its wings are like clouds arcing across the heavens. "Like Of a Flock, whose wings arc across the heavens, the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon. At the same time, the wings of every other being's consciousness span to the horizon. You are of a flock, one bird among kin."[50]\n\nMind–body problem [ edit ]\n\nIllustration of mind–body dualism by René Descartes. Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the pineal gland, and from there to the immaterial spirit.\n\nMental processes (such as consciousness) and physical processes (such as brain events) seem to be correlated, however the specific nature of the connection is unknown.\n\nThe first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was Descartes, and the answer he gave is known as mind–body dualism. Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things, which he called res extensa (the realm of extension).[51] He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland.[52]	10	{"length": 1707, "index": 10}

Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories: dualist solutions that maintain Descartes's rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and monist solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects. Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants. The two main types of dualism are substance dualism (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics), and property dualism (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind). The three main types of monism are physicalism (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), idealism (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and neutral monism (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them). There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.[54]	11	{"length": 1506, "index": 11}

The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie, in his book Man a Machine (L'homme machine). His arguments, however, were very abstract.[55] The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman[56] and Antonio Damasio,[57] and by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett,[58] seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as Christof Koch,[59] have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness.[60]\n\nA few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness.[61] Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel[62] could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.[63] Empirical evidence is against the notion of quantum consciousness, an experiment about wave function collapse led by Catalina Curceanu in 2022 suggests that quantum consciousness, as suggested by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, is highly implausible.[64]	12	{"length": 2359, "index": 12}

The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.\n\nProblem of other minds [ edit ]\n\nMany philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological question: Given that I can only observe the behavior of others, how can I know that others have minds?[66] The problem of other minds is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.[67] Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois,[68] and by Colin Allen (a professor at the University of Pittsburgh) regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.[69]	13	{"length": 1485, "index": 13}

For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe.[70] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in a research paper titled "The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies", argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying.[71] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.[72]\n\nQualia [ edit ]\n\nThe term "qualia" was introduced in philosophical literature by C. I. Lewis. The word is derived from Latin and means "of what sort". It is basically a quantity or property of something as perceived or experienced by an individual, like the scent of rose, the taste of wine, or the pain of a headache. They are difficult to articulate or describe. The philosopher and scientist Daniel Dennett describes them as "the way things seem to us", while philosopher and cognitive scientist David Chalmers expanded on qualia as the "hard problem of consciousness" in the 1990s. When qualia is experienced, activity is simulated in the brain, and these processes are called neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). Many scientific studies have been done to attempt to link particular brain regions with emotions or experiences.[73][74][75]\n\nSpecies which experience qualia are said to have sentience, which is central to the animal rights movement, because it includes the ability to experience pain and suffering.[73]\n\nScientific study [ edit ]	14	{"length": 2184, "index": 14}

Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called Consciousness Studies, giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books,[79] journals such as Consciousness and Cognition, Frontiers in Consciousness Research, Psyche, and the Journal of Consciousness Studies, along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness[80] and the Society for Consciousness Studies.\n\nModern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli),[81] and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs. Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts. The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired. In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.[59]\n\nMeasurement via verbal report [ edit ]\n\nThe Necker cube, an ambiguous image	15	{"length": 2127, "index": 15}

Mine is the proverbial office watercooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged. I hope to enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the judgments and choices of others, the company’s new policies, or a colleague’s investment decisions. Why be concerned with gossip? Because it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own. Questioning what we believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult when we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions of others. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a powerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year resolutions to improve one’s decision making at work and at home. To be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of labels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its symptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and consequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness. Learning medicine consists in part of learning the language of medicine. A deeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer vocabulary than is available in everyday language. The hope for informed gossip is that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make. Systematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in particular circumstances. When the handsome and confident speaker bounds onto the stage, for example, you can anticipate that the audience will judge his comments more favorably than he deserves. The availability of a diagnostic label for this bias—the halo effect—makes it easier to anticipate, recognize, and understand. When you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally answer. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way. Most impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without your knowing how they got there.	0	{"length": 2432, "index": 0}

The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and many decisions goes on in silence in our mind. Much of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition. However, the focus on error does not denigrate human intelligence, any more than the attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health. Most of us are healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are appropriate most of the time. As we navigate our lives, we normally allow ourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence we have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not always. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are. So this is my aim for watercooler conversations: improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest an intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often cause. Origins	3	{"length": 1214, "index": 3}

Amos and I enjoyed the exchange and concluded that intuitive statistics was an interesting topic and that it would be fun to explore it together. That Friday we met for lunch at Café Rimon, the favorite hangout of bohemians and professors in Jerusalem, and planned a study of the statistical intuitions of sophisticated researchers. We had concluded in the seminar that our own intuitions were deficient. In spite of years of teaching and using statistics, we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of statistical results observed in small samples. Our subjective judgments were biased: we were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research. The goal of our study was to examine whether other researchers suffered from the same affliction. We prepared a survey that included realistic scenarios of statistical issues that arise in research. Amos collected the responses of a group of expert participants in a meeting of the Society of Mathematical Psychology, including the authors of two statistical textbooks. As expected, we found that our expert colleagues, like us, greatly exaggerated the likelihood that the original result of an experiment would be successfully replicated even with a small sample. They also gave very poor advice to a fictitious graduate student about the number of observations she needed to collect. Even statisticians were not good intuitive statisticians. While writing the article that reported these findings, Amos and I discovered that we enjoyed working together. Amos was always very funny, and in his presence I became funny as well, so we spent hours of solid work in continuous amusement. The pleasure we found in working together made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. Perhaps most important, we checked our critical weapons at the door. Both Amos and I were critical and argumentative, he even more than I, but during the years of our collaboration neither of us ever rejected out of hand anything the other said. Indeed, one of the great joys I found in the collaboration was that Amos frequently saw the point of my vague ideas much more clearly than I did. Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and an unfailing sense of direction. I was more intuitive and rooted in the psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas.	4	{"length": 2477, "index": 4}

However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I asked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the Department of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Amos Tversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research—indeed, in anything he did—so I knew we would have an interesting time. Many people who knew Amos thought he was the most intelligent person they had ever met. He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic. He was also blessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use them to make a point. There was never a dull moment when Amos was around. He was then thirty-two; I was thirty-five. Amos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the University of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people good intuitive statisticians? We already knew that people are good intuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules of grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist. Do people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics? Amos reported that the answer was a qualified yes. We had a lively debate in the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better	6	{"length": 1414, "index": 6}

Each question was a small experiment, and we carried out many experiments in a single day. We were not seriously looking for the correct answer to the statistical questions we posed. Our aim was to identify and analyze the intuitive answer, the first one that came to mind, the one we were tempted to make even when we knew it to be wrong. We believed—correctly, as it happened—that any intuition that the two of us shared would be shared by many other people as well, and that it would be easy to demonstrate its effects on judgments. We once discovered with great delight that we had identical silly ideas about the future professions of several toddlers we both knew. We could identify the argumentative three-year-old lawyer, the nerdy professor, the empathetic and mildly intrusive psychotherapist. Of course these predictions were absurd, but we still found them appealing. It was also clear that our intuitions were governed by the resemblance of each child to the cultural stereotype of a profession. The amusing exercise helped us develop a theory that was emerging in our minds at the time, about the role of resemblance in predictions. We went on to test and elaborate that theory in dozens of experiments, as in the following example. As you consider the next question, please assume that Steve was selected at random from a representative sample:\n\nAn individual has been described by a neighbor as follows: “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.” Is Steve more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?	7	{"length": 1779, "index": 7}

Did it occur to you that there are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United States? Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks. However, we found that participants in our experiments ignored the relevant statistical facts and relied exclusively on resemblance. We proposed that they used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic (roughly, a rule of thumb) to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions. On another occasion, Amos and I wondered about the rate of divorce among professors in our university. We noticed that the question triggered a search of memory for divorced professors we knew or knew about, and that we judged the size of categories by the ease with which instances came to mind. We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the availability heuristic. In one of our studies, we asked participants to answer a simple question about words in a typical English text:\n\nConsider the letter K. Is K more likely to appear as the first letter in a word OR as the third letter?	8	{"length": 1390, "index": 8}

Second, emotions such as fear, affection, and hatred explain most of the occasions on which people depart from rationality. Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly. We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by emotion. Our article attracted much more attention than we had expected, and it remains one of the most highly cited works in social science (more than three hundred scholarly articles referred to it in 2010). Scholars in other disciplines found it useful, and the ideas of heuristics and biases have been used productively in many fields, including medical diagnosis, legal judgment, intelligence analysis, philosophy, finance, statistics, and military strategy. For example, students of policy have noted that the availability heuristic helps explain why some issues are highly salient in the public’s mind while others are neglected. People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common. For several weeks after Michael Jackson’s death, for example, it was virtually impossible to find a television channel reporting on another topic. In contrast, there is little coverage of critical but unexciting issues that provide less drama, such as declining educational standards or overinvestment of medical resources in the last year of life. (As I write this, I notice that my choice of “little-covered” examples was guided by availability.	9	{"length": 2104, "index": 9}

Having seen themselves fail, they became more likely to question the dogmatic assumption, prevalent at the time, that the human mind is rational and logical. The choice of method was crucial: if we had reported results of only conventional experiments, the article would have been less noteworthy and less memorable. Furthermore, skeptical readers would have distanced themselves from the results by attributing judgment errors to the familiar fecklessness of undergraduates, the typical participants in psychological studies. Of course, we did not choose demonstrations over standard experiments because we wanted to influence philosophers and economists. We preferred demonstrations because they were more fun, and we were lucky in our choice of method as well as in many other ways. A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome. Our story was no exception. The reaction to our work was not uniformly positive. In particular, our focus on biases was criticized as suggesting an unfairly negative view of the mind. As expected in normal science, some investigators refined our ideas and others offered plausible alternatives. By and large, though, the idea that our minds are susceptible to systematic errors is now generally accepted. Our research on judgment had far more effect on social science than we thought possible when we were working on it. Immediately after completing our review of judgment, we switched our attention to decision making under uncertainty. Our goal was to develop a psychological theory of how people make decisions about simple gambles. For example: Would you accept a bet on the toss of a coin where you win $130 if the coin shows heads and lose $100 if it shows tails? These elementary choices had long been used to examine broad questions about decision making, such as the relative weight that people assign to sure things and to uncertain outcomes. Our method did not change: we spent many days making up choice problems and examining whether our intuitive preferences conformed to the logic of choice.	11	{"length": 2397, "index": 11}

Five years after the *Science* article, we published “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk,” a theory of choice that is, by some counts, more influential than our work on judgment, and is one of the foundations of behavioral economics.	12	{"length": 409, "index": 12}

This is true for every letter of the alphabet. We therefore expected respondents to exaggerate the frequency of letters appearing in the first position—even those letters (such as K, L, N, R, V) which in fact occur more frequently in the third position. Here again, the reliance on a heuristic produces a predictable bias in judgments. For example, I recently came to doubt my long-held impression that adultery is more common among politicians than among physicians or lawyers. I had even come up with explanations for that “fact,” including the aphrodisiac effect of power and the temptations of life away from home. I eventually realized that the transgressions of politicians are much more likely to be reported than the transgressions of lawyers and doctors. My intuitive impression could be due entirely to journalists’ choices of topics and to my reliance on the availability heuristic. Amos and I spent several years studying and documenting biases of intuitive thinking in various tasks—assigning probabilities to events, forecasting the future, assessing hypotheses, and estimating frequencies. In the fifth year of our collaboration, we presented our main findings in Science magazine, a publication read by scholars in many disciplines. The article (which is reproduced in full at the end of this book) was titled “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.” It described the simplifying shortcuts of intuitive thinking and explained some 20 biases as manifestations of these heuristics—and also as demonstrations of the role of heuristics in judgment. Historians of science have often noted that at any given time scholars in a particular field tend to share basic assumptions about their subject. Social scientists are no exception; they rely on a view of human nature that provides the background of most discussions of specific behaviors but is rarely questioned. Social scientists in the 1970s broadly accepted two ideas about human nature. First, people are generally	13	{"length": 2167, "index": 13}

Our collaboration on judgment and decision making was the reason for the Nobel Prize that I received in 2002, which Amos would have shared had he not died, aged fifty-nine, in 1996.

Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car in the next lane is dangerous. Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced firefighter or physician—only more common. The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic. Perhaps the best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess masters and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us. You can feel Simon’s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he writes: “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” We are not surprised when a two-year-old looks at a dog and says “doggie!” because we are used to the miracle of children learning to recognize and name things. Simon’s point is that the miracles of expert intuition have the same character. Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it. Good intuitive judgments come to mind with the same immediacy as “doggie!” Unfortunately, professionals’ intuitions do not all arise from true expertise. Many years ago I visited the chief investment officer of a large financial firm, who told me that he had just invested some tens of millions of dollars in the stock of Ford Motor Company. When I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had recently attended an automobile show and had been impressed. “Boy, do they know how to make a car!” was his explanation. He made it very clear that he trusted his gut feeling and was satisfied with himself and with his decision. I found it remarkable that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist would call relevant: Is Ford stock currently underpriced? Instead, he had listened to his intuition; he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he liked the idea of owning its stock. From what we know about the accuracy of stock picking, it is reasonable to believe that he did not know what he was doing.	15	{"length": 2412, "index": 15}

We want to show that (M unstar)* ⊆ M and M ⊆ (M unstar)*.\n\nFirst, we will show that (M unstar)* ⊆ M. Take any element m ∈ M unstar. m is a codeword in M, meaning m ∈ M. So, M unstar ⊆ M. Then, by our proof in Problem Set Six Problem 6 Part IV, we know that since M unstar ⊆ M, (M unstar)* ⊆ M, which is what we wanted to show.\n\nNext, we will show that M ⊆ (M unstar)*. Let P(n) be the statement "for any string w ∈ M where |w| = n, w ∈ (M unstar)*. We will prove by induction that P(n) holds for all n ∈ N from which the theorem follows.\n\nAs our first base case, we prove P(0), that for any string w ∈ M where |w| = 0, that string can be written as a concatenation of codewords. In this case, w ∈ M where |w| = 0 is ϵ. We know ϵ ∈ (M unstar)* because the Kleene star of any set contains ϵ.\n\nAs our second base case, we prove P(1), that for any string w ∈ M where |w| = 1, w ∈ (M unstar)*. In this case, w ∈ M by construction, w ≠ ϵ, and because |w| = 1, any two x and y where xy = w requires one of x or y to be ϵ. Therefore, w is a codeword.\n\nFor our inductive step, pick some k ∈ N and assume that P(0), P(1), ..., and P(k) are true. Pick some w ∈ M where |w| = k + 1. There are two cases: Case 1: w is a codeword. Then w ∈ (M unstar), and therefore by the definition of *, w ∈ (M unstar)*. Case 2: w is not a codeword. Therefore, there exist x, y ∈ M such that w = xy and x ≠ ϵ and y ≠ ϵ. Since x and y have length > 0 and w = xy, both x and y must have length less than k + 1, and so, by the IH, each can be written as a concatenation of codewords. Therefore, w = xy is also in (M unstar)* since w can be written as a concatenation of two strings from (M unstar)*.\n\nThis completes the induction, showing M ⊆ (M unstar)*. ■\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 8 November 24, 2024\n\nProblem Five: Executable Computability Theory\n\ni.\n\n• It is the recognizer for L = {a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup> | n ∈ N}\n• Yes decider\n• Decidable\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 8 November 24, 2024\n\nii.	1	{"length": 2097, "index": 1}

You’ll submit that separately. Some notation you might want for this problem set:\n\n• The encoding of an object can be denoted ⟨M⟩. • The complement of a language is denoted L<sup>c</sup>. • You can represent different classes of languages as R, RE, co-RE, P, and NP.\n\nProblem One: This Program is Not Responding\n\nThere is no program the OS could run which could determine for sure for all programs if they are causing/will cause an infinite loop, or if they’re just running for a long time. If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate.\n- checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate.\n- checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language.\n- checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square.\n- checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers.\n- checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square.\n- checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.	0	{"length": 1779, "index": 0}

The proof does not explain why it is impossible for  trickster(w)  to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L. In fact,  trickster  is defined exactly to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L, so it is behaving as expected.\n\nii.\n\nThis is wrong when it says "Since  willAccept  decides  L  and  me  holds the source code of  trickster, we know that  willAccept(me,input)  returns  true  if and only if  trickster(input)  returns  true." That is wrong because there’s nothing about  trickster(input)  that influences whether  willAccept(me,input)  would return true. That if and only if only applied in the  ATM  case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language  L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how  trickster  is written, we see that  isValid(me)  returns true if and only if  trickster  is not syntactically valid. This assumes that if  isValid  returns false, then in the else statement, having valid syntax means  trickster  has valid syntax. However,  trickster  has invalid syntax even if we branch into the  else  condition because invalid syntax doesn’t rely on which lines of the program get run; just having incorrect syntax earlier in the program makes it invalid even if the else condition is valid.\n\nProblem Four: Double Verification\n\nbool isInL(string w): − for (each string c) −− if checkInL(w, c) return true −− if checkInLBar(w, c) return false	1	{"length": 1984, "index": 1}

Assume for the sake of contradiction that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know that ATM is recognizable; that is, for any word w ∈ Σ*, there exists a recognizer M which accepts w if and only if w ∈ ATM. Since ATM ∈ co-RE, we know for any w ∈ ATM that there exists a recognizer W which accepts w if and only if w ∉ ATM. Thus, since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, ATM is decidable, since a language is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are recognizable. However, ATM is not decidable, as proven by self-reference in Lecture 24; so we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption must be incorrect. ∎\n\nii.\n\nreturn isInAuplusB("0" + w)\n\niii.\n\nreturn isInComplementAuplusB("1" + w)\n\niv.\n\nProof: We want to show that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE and that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ RE. We know from part 2 that this means LD ∈ RE. But, we know LD ∉ RE; thus, we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE.\n\nAssume also for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from part 3 that this means that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from the definition of co-RE that if ATM ∈ co-RE, ATM ∈ RE. Since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, then ATM is decidable. However, we know ATM is not decidable. Thus we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE.\n\nOptional Fun Problem: Undecidability Phase Transitions\n\nWrite your answer to the Optional Fun Problem here.\n\nGrand Challenge Problem: P ?= NP\n\nWrite your response to the Grand Challenge Problem here.\n\nCongratulations on finishing the last problem set of the quarter!	2	{"length": 1752, "index": 2}

But on the concrete road Al built up his speed because the flattened springs were not in danger any more. From Sallisaw to Gore is twenty-one miles and the Hudson was doing thirty-five miles an hour. From Gore to Warner thirteen miles; Warner to Checotah fourteen miles; Checotah a long jump to Henrietta—thirty-four miles, but a real town at the end of it. Henrietta to Castle nineteen miles, and the sun was overhead, and the red fields, heated by the high sun, vibrated the air.\n\nAl, at the wheel, his face purposeful, his whole body listening to the car, his restless eyes jumping from the road to the instrument panel. Al was one with his engine, every nerve listening for weaknesses, for the thumps or squeals, hums and chattering that indicate a change that may cause a breakdown. He had become the soul of the car.\n\nGranma, beside him on the seat, half slept, and whimpered in her sleep, opened her eyes to peer ahead, and then dozed again. And Ma sat beside Granma, one elbow out the window, and the skin reddening under the fierce sun. Ma looked ahead too, but her eyes were flat and did not see the road or the fields, the gas stations, the little eating sheds. She did not glance at them as the Hudson went by.\n\nAl shifted himself on the broken seat and changed his grip on the steering wheel. And he sighed, “Makes a racket, but I think she’s awright. God knows what she’ll do if we got to climb a hill with the load we got. Got any hills ’tween here an’ California, Ma?”\n\nMa turned her head slowly and her eyes came to life. “Seems to me they’s hills,” she said. “’Course I dunno. But seems to me I heard they’s hills an’ even mountains. Big ones.”\n\nGranma drew a long whining sigh in her sleep.\n\nAl said, “We’ll burn right up if we got climbin’ to do. Have to throw out some a’ this stuff. Maybe we shouldn’ a brang that preacher.”\n\n“You’ll be glad a that preacher ’fore we’re through,” said Ma. “That preacher’ll help us.” She looked ahead at the gleaming road again.\n\nAl steered with one hand and put the other on the vibrating gear-shift lever. He had difficulty in speaking. His mouth formed the words silently before he said them aloud. “Ma—” She looked slowly around at him, her head swaying a little with the car’s motion. “Ma, you scared a goin’?

Up ahead they’s a thousand lives we might live, but when it comes, it’ll on’y be one. If I go ahead on all of ’em, it’s too much. You got to live ahead ’cause you’re so young, but— it’s jus’ the road goin’ by for me. An’ it’s jus’ how soon they gonna wanta eat some more pork bones.” Her face tightened. “That’s all I can do. I can’t do no more. All the rest’d get upset if I done any more’n that. They all depen’ on me jus’ thinkin’ about that.”\n\nGranma yawned shrilly and opened her eyes. She looked wildly about. “I got to get out, praise Gawd,” she said.\n\n“First clump a brush,” said Al. “They’s one up ahead.”\n\n“Brush or no brush, I got to git out, I tell ya.” And she began to whine, “I got to git out. I got to git out.”\n\nAl speeded up, and when he came to the low brush he pulled up short. Ma threw the door open and half pulled the struggling old lady out beside the road and into the bushes. And Ma held her so Granma would not fall when she squatted.\n\nOn top of the truck the others stirred to life. Their faces were shining with sunburn they could not escape. Tom and Casy and Noah and Uncle John let themselves wearily down. Ruthie and Winfield swarmed down the side-boards and went off into the bushes. Connie helped Rose of Sharon gently down. Under the canvas, Grampa was awake, his head sticking out, but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless. He watched the others, but there was little recognition in his watching.\n\nTom called to him, “Want to come down, Grampa?”\n\nThe old eyes turned listlessly to him. “No,” said Grampa. For a moment the fierceness came into his eyes. “I ain’t a-goin’, I tell you. Gonna stay like Muley.” And then he lost interest again. Ma came back, helping Granma up the bank to the highway.\n\n“Tom,” she said. “Get that pan a bones, under the canvas in back. We got to eat somepin.” Tom got the pan and passed it around, and the family stood by the roadside, gnawing the crisp particles from the pork bones.\n\n“Sure lucky we brang these along,” said Pa. “Git so stiff up there can’t hardly move.

We must a forgot it.”\n\nThirst set in instantly. Winfield moaned, “I wanta drink. I wanta drink.” The men licked their lips, suddenly conscious of their thirst. And a little panic started.\n\nAl felt the fear growing. “We’ll get water first service station we come to. We need some gas too.” The family swarmed up the truck sides; Ma helped Granma in and got in beside her. Al started the motor and they moved on.\n\nCastle to Paden twenty-five miles and the sun passed the zenith and started down. And the radiator cap began to jiggle up and down and steam started to whish out. Near Paden there was a shack beside the road and two gas pumps in front of it; and beside a fence, a water faucet and a hose. Al drove in and nosed the Hudson up to the hose. As they pulled in, a stout man, red of face and arms, got up from a chair behind the gas pumps and moved toward them. He wore brown corduroys, and suspenders and a polo shirt; and he had a cardboard sun helmet, painted silver, on his head. The sweat beaded on his nose and under his eyes and formed streams in the wrinkles of his neck. He strolled toward the truck, looking truculent and stern.\n\n“You folks aim to buy anything? Gasoline or stuff?” he asked.\n\nAl was out already, unscrewing the steaming radiator cap with the tips of his fingers, jerking his hand away to escape the spurt when the cap should come loose. “Need some gas, mister.”\n\n“Got any money?”\n\n“Sure. Think we’re beggin’?”\n\nThe truculence left the fat man’s face. “Well, that’s all right, folks. Help yourself to water.” And he hastened to explain. “Road is full a people, come in, use water, dirty up the toilet, an’ then, by God, they’ll steal stuff an’ don’t buy nothin’. Got no money to buy with. Come beggin’ a gallon gas to move on.”\n\nTom dropped angrily to the ground and moved toward the fat man. “We’re payin’ our way,” he said fiercely. “You got no call to give us a goin’-over. We ain’t asked you for nothin’.”\n\n“I ain’t,” the fat man said quickly. The sweat began to soak through his short-sleeved polo shirt. “Jus’ help yourself to water, and go use the toilet if you want.”\n\nWinfield had got the hose. He drank from the end and then turned the stream over his head and face, and emerged dripping, “It ain’t cool,” he said.	2	{"length": 2386, "index": 2}

His complaint had shifted now and he was no longer talking to or about the Joads. “Fifty-sixty cars a folks go by ever’ day, folks all movin’ west with kids an’ househol’ stuff. Where they goin’? What they gonna do?”\n\n“Doin’ the same as us,” said Tom. “Goin’ someplace to live. Tryin’ to get along. That’s all.”\n\n“Well, I don’ know what the country’s comin’ to. I jus’ don’ know. Here’s me tryin’ to get along, too. Think any them big new cars stops here? No, sir! They go on to them yella-painted company stations in town. They don’t stop no place like this. Most folks stops here ain’t got nothin’.”\n\nAl flipped the radiator cap and it jumped into the air with a head of steam behind it, and a hollow bubbling sound came out of the radiator. On top of the truck, the suffering hound dog crawled timidly to the edge of the load and looked over, whimpering, toward the water. Uncle John climbed up and lifted him down by the scruff of the neck. For a moment the dog staggered on stiff legs, and then he went to lap the mud under the faucet. In the highway the cars whizzed by, glistening in the heat, and the hot wind of their going fanned into the service-station yard. Al filled the radiator with water.\n\n“I ain’t sayin’ that I’m tryin’ to git trade outa rich folks,” the fat man went on. “I’m jus’ tryin’ to git trade. Why, the folks that stops here begs gasoline an’ they trades for gasoline. I could show you in my back room the stuff they’ll trade for gas an’ oil: beds an’ baby buggies an’ pots an’ pans. One family traded a doll their kid had for a gallon. An’ what’m I gonna do with the stuff, open a junk shop? Why, one fella wanted to gimme his shoes for a gallon. An’ if I was that kinda fella I bet I could git—” He glanced at Ma and stopped.\n\nJim Casy had wet his head, and the drops still coursed down his high forehead, and his muscled neck was wet, and his shirt was wet. He moved over beside Tom. “It ain’t the people’s fault,” he said. “How’d you like to sell the bed you sleep on for a tankful a gas?”	3	{"length": 2088, "index": 3}

Just like the beloved, who, after much insistence, finally stands in the presence of the maid in love, though he is there before her, he does not give her any pleasure until she recognizes who he is—as he seems just like other men until that moment—, so for mankind the self, who is yet the Lord of the world, cannot manifest his own glory until his qualities have been brought to light. For this reason, the doctrine of the recognition of the Lord has here been expounded. The example of the beloved shows that the recognition of the Lord must be awakened30 and that its fruit is extraordinary. — 17 —\n\n30 Utp. uses the causative form of the root upapad-, as he has done before, in his oscillation between the meanings of ‘awaken’, ‘render possible’, and ‘justify logically’ (cf. also the following kārikā).\n\n18.

But what’s the country comin’ to? That’s what I wanta know. What’s it comin’ to? Fella can’t make a livin’ no more. Folks can’t make a livin’ farmin’. I ask you, what’s it comin’ to? I can’t figure her out. Ever’body I ask, they can’t figure her out. Fella wants to trade his shoes so he can git a hundred miles on. I can’t figure her out.” He took off his silver hat and wiped his forehead with his palm. And Tom took off his cap and wiped his forehead with it. He went to the hose and wet the cap through and squeezed it and put it on again. Ma worked a tin cup out through the side bars of the truck, and she took water to Granma and to Grampa on top of the load. She stood on the bars and handed the cup to Grampa, and he wet his lips, and then shook his head and refused more. The old eyes looked up at Ma in pain and bewilderment for a moment before the awareness receded again.\n\nAl started the motor and backed the truck to the gas pump. “Fill her up. She’ll take about seven,” said Al. “We’ll give her six so she don’t spill none.”\n\nThe fat man put the hose in the tank. “No, sir,” he said. “I jus’ don’t know what the country’s comin’ to. Relief an’ all.”\n\nCasy said, “I been walkin’ aroun’ in the country. Ever’body’s askin’ that. What we comin’ to? Seems to me we don’t never come to nothin’. Always on the way.

I seen fellas like you before. You ain’t askin’ nothin’; you’re jus’ singin’ a kinda song. ‘What we comin’ to?’ You don’ wanta know. Country’s movin’ aroun’, goin’ places. They’s folks dyin’ all aroun’. Maybe you’ll die pretty soon, but you won’t know nothin’. I seen too many fellas like you. You don’t want to know nothin’. Just sing yourself to sleep with a song— ‘What we comin’ to?’” He looked at the gas pump, rusted and old, and at the shack behind it, built of old lumber, the nail holes of its first use still showing through the paint that had been brave, the brave yellow paint that had tried to imitate the big company stations in town. But the paint couldn’t cover the old nail holes and the old cracks in the lumber, and the paint could not be renewed. The imitation was a failure and the owner had known it was a failure. And inside the open door of the shack Tom saw the oil barrels, only two of them, and the candy counter with stale candies and licorice whips turning brown with age, and cigarettes. He saw the broken chair and the fly screen with a rusted hole in it. And the littered yard that should have been graveled, and behind, the corn field drying and dying in the sun. Beside the house the little stock of used tires and retreaded tires. And he saw for the first time the fat man’s cheap washed pants and his cheap polo shirt and his paper hat. He said, “I didn’ mean to sound off at ya, mister. It’s the heat. You ain’t got nothin’. Pretty soon you’ll be on the road yourse’f. And it ain’t tractors’ll put you there. It’s them pretty yella stations in town. Folks is movin’,” he said ashamedly. “An’ you’ll be movin’, mister.”\n\nThe fat man’s hand slowed on the pump and stopped while Tom spoke. He looked worriedly at Tom. “How’d you know?” he asked helplessly, “How’d you know we was already talkin’ about packin’ up an’ movin’ west?”	5	{"length": 1983, "index": 5}

But they’s somethin’ worse’n the devil got hold a the country, an’ it ain’t gonna let go till it’s chopped loose. Ever see one a them Gila monsters take hold, mister?

An’ while he’s layin’ there, poison is drippin’ an’ drippin’ into the hole he’s made with his teeth.” He stopped and looked sideways at Tom.\n\nThe fat man stared hopelessly straight ahead. His hand started turning the crank slowly. “I dunno what we’re comin’ to,” he said softly.\n\nOver by the water hose, Connie and Rose of Sharon stood together, talking secretly. Connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup again. Rose of Sharon watched the cars go by on the highway. Connie held out the cup to her. “This water ain’t cool, but it’s wet,” he said.\n\nShe looked at him and smiled secretly. She was all secrets now she was pregnant, secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings. She was pleased with herself, and she complained about things that didn’t really matter. And she demanded services of Connie that were silly, and both of them knew they were silly. Connie was pleased with her too, and filled with wonder that she was pregnant. He liked to think he was in on the secrets she had. When she smiled slyly, he smiled slyly too, and they exchanged confidences in whispers. The world had drawn close around them, and they were in the center of it, or rather Rose of Sharon was in the center of it with Connie making a small orbit about her. Everything they said was a kind of secret.\n\nShe drew her eyes from the highway. “I ain’t very thirsty,” she said daintily. “But maybe I ought to drink.”\n\nAnd he nodded, for he knew well what she meant. She took the cup and rinsed her mouth and spat and then drank the cupful of tepid water. “Want another?” he asked.\n\n“Jus’ a half.” And so he filled the cup just half, and gave it to her. A Lincoln Zephyr, silvery and low, whisked by. She turned to see where the others were and saw them clustered about the truck. Reassured, she said, “How’d you like to be goin’ along in that?”	6	{"length": 2365, "index": 6}

But them”—he indicated the disappearing Zephyr—“them kind costs as much as a good size house. I’d ruther have the house.”\n\n“I’d like to have the house an’ one a them,” she said. “But ’course the house would be first because—” And they both knew what she meant. They were terribly excited about the pregnancy.\n\n“You feel awright?” he asked.\n\n“Tar’d. Jus’ tar’d ridin’ in the sun.”\n\n“We got to do that or we won’t never get to California.”\n\n“I know,” she said.\n\nThe dog wandered, sniffing, past the truck, trotted to the puddle under the hose again and lapped at the muddy water. And then he moved away, nose down and ears hanging. He sniffed his way among the dusty weeds beside the road, to the edge of the pavement. He raised his head and looked across, and then started over. Rose of Sharon screamed shrilly. A big swift car whisked near; tires squealed. The dog dodged helplessly, and with a shriek, cut off in the middle, went under the wheels. The big car slowed for a moment and faces looked back, and then it gathered greater speed and disappeared. And the dog, a blot of blood and tangled, burst intestines, kicked slowly in the road.\n\nRose of Sharon’s eyes were wide. “D’you think it’ll hurt?” she begged. “Think it’ll hurt?”\n\nConnie put his arm around her. “Come set down,” he said. “It wasn’t nothin’.”\n\n“But I felt it hurt. I felt it kinda jar when I yelled.”\n\n“Come set down. It wasn’t nothin’. It won’t hurt.” He led her to the side of the truck away from the dying dog and sat her down on the running board.\n\nTom and Uncle John walked out to the mess. The last quiver was going out of the crushed body. Tom took it by the legs and dragged it to the side of the road. Uncle John looked embarrassed, as though it were his fault. “I ought ta tied him up,” he said.\n\nPa looked down at the dog for a moment and then he turned away. “Le’s get outa here,” he said. “I don’t know how we was gonna feed ’im anyways. Just as well, maybe.”\n\nThe fat man came from behind the truck. “I’m sorry, folks,” he said. “A dog jus’ don’ last no time near a highway. I had three dogs run over in a year. Don’t keep none, no more.” And he said, “Don’t you folks worry none about it. I’ll take care of ’im. Bury ’im out in the corn field.”\n\nMa walked over to Rose of Sharon, where she sat, still shuddering, on the running board. “You all right, Rosasharn?” she asked. “You feelin’ poorly?”	7	{"length": 2506, "index": 7}

Give me a start.”\n\n“I heard ya yip,” said Ma. “Git yourself laced up, now.”\n\n“You suppose it might of hurt?”\n\n“No,” said Ma. “’F you go to greasin’ yourself an’ feelin’ sorry, an’ tuckin’ yourself in a swalla’s nest, it might. Rise up now, an’ he’p me get Granma comfortable. Forget that baby for a minute. He’ll take care a hisself.”\n\n“Where is Granma?” Rose of Sharon asked.\n\n“I dunno. She’s aroun’ here somewheres. Maybe in the outhouse.”\n\nThe girl went toward the toilet, and in a moment she came out, helping Granma along. “She went to sleep in there,” said Rose of Sharon.\n\nGranma grinned. “It’s nice in there,” she said. “They got a patent toilet in there an’ the water comes down. I like it in there,” she said contentedly. “Would of took a good nap if I wasn’t woke up.”\n\n“It ain’t a nice place to sleep,” said Rose of Sharon, and she helped Granma into the car. Granma settled herself happily. “Maybe it ain’t nice for purty, but it’s nice for nice,” she said.\n\nTom said, “Le’s go. We got to make miles.”\n\nPa whistled shrilly. “Now where’d them kids go?” He whistled again, putting his fingers in his mouth.\n\nIn a moment they broke from the corn field, Ruthie ahead and Winfield trailing her. “Eggs!” Ruthie cried. “I got soft eggs.” She rushed close, with Winfield close behind. “Look!” A dozen soft, grayish-white eggs were in her grubby hand. And as she held up her hand, her eyes fell upon the dead dog beside the road. “Oh!” she said. Ruthie and Winfield walked slowly toward the dog. They inspected him.\n\nPa called to them, “Come on, you, ’less you want to git left.”\n\nThey turned solemnly and walked to the truck. Ruthie looked once more at the gray reptile eggs in her hand, and then she threw them away. They climbed up the side of the track. “His eyes was still open,” said Ruthie in a hushed tone.\n\nBut Winfield gloried in the scene. He said boldly, “His guts was just strowed all over—all over”—he was silent for a moment—“strowed—all—over,” he said, and then he rolled over quickly and vomited down the side of the track. When he sat up again his eyes were watery and his nose running. “It ain’t like killin’ pigs,” he said in explanation.\n\nAl had the hood of the Hudson up, and he checked the oil level. He brought a gallon can from the floor of the front seat and poured a quantity of cheap black oil into the pipes and checked the level again.\n\nTom came beside him. “Want I should take her a piece?” he asked.\n\n“I ain’t tired,” said Al.	8	{"length": 2476, "index": 8}

I’ll take her.”\n\n“Awright,” Al said reluctantly. “But watch the oil gauge pretty close. Take her slow. An’ I been watchin’ for a short. Take a look a the needle now an’ then. ’F she jumps to, discharge it’s a short. An’ take her slow, Tom. She’s overloaded.”\n\nTom laughed. “I’ll watch her,” he said. “You can rest easy.”\n\nThe family piled on top of the truck again. Ma settled herself beside Granma in the seat, and Tom took his place and started the motor. “Sure is loose,” he said, and he put it in gear and pulled away down the highway.\n\nThe motor droned along steadily and the sun receded down the sky in front of them. Granma slept steadily, and even Ma dropped her head forward and dozed. Tom pulled his cap over his eyes to shut out the blinding sun.\n\nPaden to Meeker is thirteen miles; Meeker to Harrah is fourteen miles; and then Oklahoma City—the big city. Tom drove straight on. Ma waked up and looked at the streets as they went through the city. And the family, on top of the truck, stared about at the stores, at the big houses, at the office buildings. And then the buildings grew smaller and the stores smaller. The wrecking yards and hot-dog stands, the out-city dance halls.\n\nRuthie and Winfield saw it all, and it embarrassed them with its bigness and its strangeness, and it frightened them with the fine-clothed people they saw. They did not speak of it to each other. Later—they would, but not now. They saw the oil derricks in the town, on the edge of the town; oil derricks black, and the smell of oil and gas in the air. But they didn’t exclaim. It was so big and so strange it frightened them.\n\nIn the street Rose of Sharon saw a man in a light suit. He wore white shoes and a flat straw hat. She touched Connie and indicated the man with her eyes, and then Connie and Rose of Sharon giggled softly to themselves, and the giggles got the best of them. They covered their mouths. And it felt so good that they looked for other people to giggle at. Ruthie and Winfield saw them giggling and it looked such fun that they tried to do it too—but they couldn’t. The giggles wouldn’t come. But Connie and Rose of Sharon were breathless and red with stifling laughter before they could stop. It got so bad that they had only to look at each other to start over again.	9	{"length": 2378, "index": 9}

Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules’ behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.\n\n1 Introduction	0	{"length": 1665, "index": 0}

Traditional AI methodologies predominantly involve training models on high-quality datasets inherently imbued with human intelligence—such as natural language corpora, expert-annotated datasets, or data reflecting human cognitive processes (Coleman et al., 2019). This approach operates under the assumption that creating intelligent behavior necessitates exposure to intelligent data sources. In contrast, this paper explores an alternative hypothesis: that intelligence can emerge from modeling simple systems as long as they exhibit complex behaviors, even when the process that generates the data lacks inherent intelligence. To investigate this hypothesis, we utilize Stephen Wolfram’s elementary cellular automata (ECA) as our experimental framework. ECAs are one-dimensional, binary-state, discrete computational systems defined by 256 possible 8-bit rules. They generate a diverse spectrum of behaviors ranging\n\n* These authors contributed equally. † Corresponding author\n\n1 arXiv:2410.02536v2  [cs.AI]  8 Oct 2024	1	{"length": 1225, "index": 1}

Despite their simple rule-based definitions, certain ECAs produce patterns of significant complexity, making them ideal for examining the relationship between intelligence and complexity. Our methodology involves training separate instances of the GPT-2 language model (Radford et al., 2019) on datasets generated by individual ECAs. The models are tasked with predicting future states of the automata. Following this pretraining phase, we evaluate the models’ “intelligence” by quantifying performance on downstream logical reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. This paper presents an extensive study exploring the relationship between system complexity and the emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs). We discover a positive correlation between the complexity of the ECA rules and the downstream performance of models trained on them, highlighting the role of complexity in fostering intelligent behavior. Surprisingly, we find that models can learn complex solutions when trained on simple rules. Our results point to an optimal complexity level, or “edge of chaos”, conducive to intelligence, where the system is structured yet challenging to predict. These findings enhance our understanding of intelligence in artificial systems and provide a framework for future research focused on the importance of complexity in developing these systems.\n\n2 Background\n\n2.1 Elementary Cellular Automata	2	{"length": 1509, "index": 2}
d1b50662-e4d8-4a9c-b92a-4ad23b998673	97034b7f-8ec3-4743-b1c7-d312401d0ea2	Cellular automata (CAs) are computational models of complex systems, consisting of a grid of cells that evolve over time based on simple rules. They were first introduced by John von Neumann in the 1940s (von Neumann, 1966). CAs have been widely used to simulate various physical, biological, and computational systems due to their simplicity and ability to produce complex behavior. Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) (Wolfram & Mallinckrodt, 1994) are a type of one-dimensional cellular automaton where each cell has a binary state, and its next state is determined by a simple rule that depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors. There are 256 possible ECA rules, 88 of which are unique after accounting for symmetries (Castillo-Ramirez & Magaña-Chavez, 2023). Notable examples include Rule 110, which has been proven to be Turing complete (Cook, 2009), and Rule 90, which generates the fractal-like Sierpinski triangle. These rules are categorized into four classes based on their behavior when initialized with random conditions: Class I, which evolves to a homogeneous state; Class II, which forms simple periodic structures; Class III, which produces chaotic and aperiodic patterns; and Class IV, which exhibits complex structures (Castillo-Ramirez & Magaña-Chavez, 2023). ECAs are valuable computational models used to explore complex systems and emergent behaviors arising from simple rules. Their usefulness lies in their simplicity and the variety of patterns they can produce, making them ideal for studying pattern formation in computation (Meunier, 2016), physics (Banerjee & Dalui, 2024), and mathematical biology (Rasolonjanahary & Vasiev, 2020). Additionally, ECAs have been utilized in cryptography as a basis of certain security frameworks (Corona-Bermúdez et al., 2022) and in computer science education (Staubitz et al., 2016) to illustrate concepts in algorithms and computational theory. Their ability to model intricate systems with minimal computational resources has made ECAs a popular tool across scientific disciplines.\n\n2.2 Large Language Models	3	{"length": 2112, "index": 3}
a107b6a5-65a4-48b8-8c60-4e4aeee5d7ee	97034b7f-8ec3-4743-b1c7-d312401d0ea2	Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast datasets (Brown et al., 2020). By leveraging deep learning techniques, these models analyze patterns in language to perform tasks such as translation, summarization, and conversational dialogue (Devlin et al., 2018). Notable examples like OpenAI’s GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics (Achiam et al., 2023). The development of LLMs represents a significant advancement in natural language processing, opening up new possibilities for applications in education, research, and industry (Katz et al., 2023).\n\nIncorporating synthetic data into the training of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to significantly boost their performance. Synthetic data generation enables the creation of large, diverse, and high-quality datasets that may not be readily available in the real world (Anaby-Tavor et al., 2019). By augmenting training data with synthetic examples, models can learn from a broader range of linguistic patterns and rare occurrences, improving their ability to generalize to unseen scenarios (Edunov, 2018). As a result, LLMs trained with synthetic data exhibit enhanced robustness, accuracy, and adaptability across various downstream tasks (Feng et al., 2021).\n\n2.3 Complexity Measures\n\nVarious complexity measures have been proposed to assess the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work, we employ the following measures:\n\n1. Lempel-Ziv Complexity assesses the compressibility of a sequence by counting the number of unique substrings in the sequence (Lempel & Ziv, 1976).\n\n2. Compression Complexity quantifies how effectively a sequence can be compressed using a data compression algorithm such as Zlib.\n\n3. Lyapunov Exponent gauges a system’s sensitivity to initial conditions. Higher Lyapunov exponents indicate that small variations in initial states result in rapidly diverging outcomes. We adopt the method proposed by Wolf (1986) for computing this metric.\n\n4. Krylov Complexity evaluates how information propagates in a system’s Hilbert space, measuring how quickly an operator spans larger regions of the state space over time (Parker et al., 2019).\n\n5. Wolfram Classification categorizes ECA rules into four categories based on behavior and complexity (see Section 2.1).	4	{"length": 2442, "index": 4}

For most analyses, we focus on Lempel-Ziv Complexity and the Wolfram Classification. Additional complexity measures are shown for performance on downstream tasks (Section 5.1).\n\n3 Methodology\n\nIn this study, we systematically investigate the relationship between system complexity and emergent intelligence. This section outlines our methodology, including the steps for data generation and model pretraining. An overview of the training process and task evaluations is provided in Figure 1.\n\n3.1 Data Generation\n\nTo train our models, we simulate a selection of ECA rules. Each simulation generates a sequence of binary vectors, where each vector represents the system’s state at a specific time step. For each sample, we begin with a randomly initialized vector as the automaton’s initial state. The system is then evolved over 1000 time steps by repeatedly applying the chosen ECA rule. This process produces a sequence of binary vectors that capture the evolving dynamics of the ECA over time. To increase the diversity of the training data, we extract random spatiotemporal windows from the full sequences. Specifically, we sample subsequences by selecting random windows of 60 time steps and 100 spatial dimensions from the binary vectors. This method exposes the model to a variety of contexts and state configurations, enhancing its ability to learn the dynamics of the ECA rules and generalize to new sequences. Each training sequence represents a randomly selected segment in space and time of the automaton’s evolution. We train models predicting either 1 or 5 steps in the future, to vary the difficulty of the task.\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Our framework for investigating the link between complexity and intelligence. We pretrain Large Language Models (LLMs) on Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) from different complexity classes using next-token prediction, then evaluate them on downstream reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. We use various measures to analyze the complexity of ECA rules, and quantify the relationship between complexity and downstream performance.\n\n3.2 Training Procedure for GPT-2 Models	5	{"length": 2221, "index": 5}

Behind him, his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.	1	{"length": 1159, "index": 1}

Instead of using a traditional token embedding layer followed by a softmax over a vocabulary, we replaced the token embeddings with a linear projection layer that directly maps binary vectors into the model’s embedding space. The GPT-2 model processes these embeddings to capture temporal dependencies and patterns within the sequences. At the output, we apply a linear projection layer to map the model’s hidden states back to the data dimensionality, generating the prediction for the next state of binary variables at each time step. This adaptation allows the GPT-2 model to handle binary data directly and perform next-token prediction without relying on a predefined vocabulary. This also makes the model deterministic, in line with the deterministic nature of ECAs.\n\n3.3 Pretraining Setup\n\nEach model was pretrained on next-token prediction using data generated from a single ECA rule for up to 10,000 epochs. Early stopping based on validation loss was utilized to prevent overfitting and conserve computational resources. The training data were organized into batches of 64 sequences, each comprising 60 time steps and 100 spatial dimensions. We employed the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate η = 2 × 10⁻⁶ and a weight decay of 0.01. A learning rate scheduler with a linear warm-up over the first 10% of the total steps was implemented to stabilize the initial stages of training and improve convergence rates. After the warm-up phase, we applied cosine annealing to gradually decay the learning rate over the remaining training steps. Gradient accumulation was used to handle larger effective batch sizes within the constraints of GPU memory, allowing us to simulate larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple mini-batches. To prevent exploding gradients, we applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0.\n\n4 Experiments\n\nTo evaluate the emergent intelligence of models trained on cellular automata, we conducted experiments on three downstream tasks: one easy and one hard reasoning task inspired by the Abstraction\n\n4	6	{"length": 2246, "index": 6}
57c33ae0-31d0-4643-9547-b817232bbac6	97034b7f-8ec3-4743-b1c7-d312401d0ea2	and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019), and a challenging chess move prediction task (Ruoss et al., 2024). These tasks were designed to quantify the models’ abilities in reasoning, abstraction, and long-term prediction, thereby assessing the level of intelligence encoded during pretraining on ECA rules of varying complexities. We freeze the layers of the pretrained GPT-2 models and train only the input and output projection layers for downstream tasks to ensure that performance differences reflect the inherent capabilities of the models. Our central hypothesis is that models pretrained on complex rules will exhibit superior performance on downstream tasks compared to those pretrained on simple rules. The inclusion of both easy and hard tasks allows us to observe different performance trends and better understand the relationship between pretraining complexity, task difficulty, and emergent intelligence. The chess move prediction task, in particular, serves as an excellent system to test reasoning due to its inherent complexity and requirement for strategic thinking.\n\n4.1 Downstream Task: Reasoning\n\nWe developed a downstream task inspired by the ARC (Chollet, 2019) to evaluate models’ problem-solving and reasoning abilities. Our approach utilizes sequence completion problems that require the model to infer transformation rules from provided examples and apply them to novel scenarios. The data consists of a fixed number of shapes on a grid. At each time step, any of the following transformations can be applied to each shape: changing the color, rotating the shape by 90◦, or shifting the shapes by one position. We designed two versions of the reasoning task, differing in complexity based on the number and type of transformations applied.\n\nEasy In the easy task, we only use 3 × 3 squares that are fixed in position and orientation. The only possible transformation is a color change, which we perform in a predetermined order.\n\nHard The hard task involves more complex patterns where all transformations are applied simultaneously. We used four distinct base shapes, each represented by a 5 × 5 matrix. This results in complex sequences where shapes change color, orientation, and position over time. The combination of these transformations requires the model to reason over multiple simultaneous changes to accurately predict the next pattern in the sequence.	7	{"length": 2392, "index": 7}

For the hard reasoning task, due to its increased complexity and difficulty, we post-trained for 10,000 epochs with a learning rate of 1 × 10⁻⁵. Early stopping based on validation loss was again used to prevent overfitting.\n\n4.2 Downstream Task: Chess Move Prediction\n\nFor the chess experiment, we evaluated the capability of the different ECA-pretrained models to predict next moves in chess games represented using Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) (Alg). We use chess games from the Lichess Elite database (Lic), focusing on games played between January and April 2016 by Grandmasters with ratings of 2200 and above. Each game was represented as a sequence of SAN moves. We split this collection into training, validation, and test sets using an 80-10-10 split to facilitate model training and evaluation. Each game sequence was segmented into subsequences of 60 moves each, and any subsequence shorter than this length was padded to length 60. We added an embedding layer to convert the SAN tokens into vector representations, which were then processed using the frozen ECA-pretrained model. A linear output layer was used to transform the outputs to the vocabulary size corresponding to the SAN tokens. These input and output layers were trained while the rest of the model was frozen. The model was trained using cross-entropy loss, the Adam optimizer (Kingma, 2014), and a learning rate scheduler with warm-up. Early stopping was also implemented.\n\n5	8	{"length": 1611, "index": 8}

The models were trained on 12 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, each with 80 GB of memory, running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8.\n\n5 Results\n\nIn this section, we present our results exploring the relationship between system complexity and emergent intelligence in LLMs. The following sections detail our analyses of task performance and attention patterns across models trained on varying rule complexities.\n\n5.1 Relationship between Intelligence and Complexity	9	{"length": 1631, "index": 9}

In terms of Wolfram’s classification, rules from Classes I and II (uniform and periodic) show lower average efficiency in the reasoning tasks compared to those from Classes III and IV (chaotic and complex). Complex rules especially outperform the other classes on the chess move prediction task. This pattern suggests that models trained on more complex rules tend to perform better on harder downstream tasks. Results with respect to other complexity measures are shown in Figure 3. We observe that models trained on certain Class III (Chaotic) rules, such as Rules 105, 146, and 150, have poorer performance on the hard reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. This behavior is expected due to chaotic systems lacking the structured patterns necessary for effective learning. In other words, they may be too random to predict, leading to weaker downstream performance. These results highlight the existence of a “sweet spot” of complexity conducive to intelligence, where the system is still predictable yet hard to predict.\n\n5.2 Models Learn Complex Solutions For Simple Rules\n\nThe elementary cellular automata (ECA) are inherently memoryless, meaning the state at the next time point is determined only by the current time point, without any consideration of past states. For each model, a straightforward solution exists: simply learning the 8-bit ECA rule and applying it to the current state to predict the next state. However, alternative solutions may also be possible, where the model leverages historical states for its predictions. The key question is whether the model is merely learning the trivial solution or if it is integrating information from the state history.\n\n7\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 168 (Uniform)\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 179 (Periodic)\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 22 (Chaotic)\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 110 (Complex)\n\nt-10 t-9 t-8 t-7 t-6 t-5 t-4 t-3 t-2 t-1 State 10⁻² 10⁻¹ Attention Score Rule 168 Rule 179 Rule 22 Rule 110\n\n20 40 60 80 100 Complexity (Lempel-Ziv) 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 Average Attention On Last 10 States r=0.66*	11	{"length": 2163, "index": 11}
b89e801b-250e-48af-86d2-a1dc1014c0d8	97034b7f-8ec3-4743-b1c7-d312401d0ea2	To explore this, we analyze the self-attention scores with respect to the last state in the input sequence, which the model uses to predict the next state (see Section 3.2). Specifically, we examine the attention values corresponding to the final ten states before the target state. Figure 4 illustrates the average attention across all layers and heads for the different ECA rules, as well as the attention at each of the last 10 states for one rule from each complexity class. Our findings reveal that models trained on rules that produce more complex dynamics tend to allocate higher attention to the last ten states, with a strong positive correlation (r=0.66) between rule complexity and average attention. This suggests that models trained on complex rules integrate information from past states to make their predictions. In contrast, models trained on simpler rules display lower attention across the last ten states. For example, Rule 168 (uniform) shows consistently low attention, indicating that previous states are not being utilized in the prediction process. Rule 179 (periodic) demonstrates a recurring pattern in its attention scores, where the model focuses on every other state. This behavior is expected by the nature of Rule 179, which produces an alternating pattern that repeats every two time steps (Figure 4). Thus, the model appears to be learning only this alternating cycle, rather than general state history. The simpler attention structure suggests that these models learn a trivial solution, which is in line with their downstream performance. We emphasize that for both simple and complex rules, a trivial solution exists: learning the 8-bit instantaneous rule and applying it to only the current state. Such a model would have no attention on previous states, as it only needs the current state to make its prediction. The fact that the complex models are attending to previous states indicates that they are learning a more complex solution to this simple problem, and we conjecture that this complexity is what makes the model “intelligent” and capable of repurposing learned reasoning to downstream tasks. We had initially expected that predicting one step in the future would be too easy, and would result in every model learning the trivial (8-bit rule) solution. As such, we trained models to predict 5 steps ahead.	12	{"length": 2354, "index": 12}

This result suggests that even when predicting the immediate next state, the models are learning nontrivial solutions (provided that the underlying rule is complex), capable of capturing complex patterns beyond the trivial rule-based approach.	13	{"length": 417, "index": 13}

Center: Attention scores for each of the last 10 states, highlighting that models trained on complex and chaotic rules focus more on recent states, while models trained on uniform rules exhibit consistently low attention. Periodic rules demonstrate a repeating attention pattern, suggesting that the model is learning to attend to earlier cycles of the same state rather than general state history. Right: Average attention across the final 10 states for all rules, plotted against Lempel-Ziv complexity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.66) indicates that models trained on higher complexity rules attend more highly to historical states during prediction.\n\nFigure 5: Performance comparison between models trained on short-term and long-term prediction tasks.

Our results show that downstream model performance improves with pretraining on more complex rules, but can deteriorate with excessive complexity or chaotic behavior, signifying a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. Attention patterns further reveal that models trained on complex rules integrate historical information into their predictions, suggesting that they are learning more sophisticated solutions to relatively simple problems. We hypothesize that this complexity in the learned representations is a key factor enabling models to generalize and perform well on downstream tasks.\n\nRelated Work\n\nElementary Cellular Automata and Complexity Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) serve as foundational models for exploring complexity arising from simple rules. Early research demonstrated that even minimalistic CA systems, governed by basic and local interaction rules, could generate intricate patterns over time (Wolfram, 1983). Wolfram’s extensive investigations into one-dimensional CA revealed that certain rules produce behaviors ranging from stable and periodic to chaotic and complex (Wolfram, 1984). In his work Cellular Automata and Complexity, Wolfram classified one-dimensional CA into four classes based on their dynamic behaviors, highlighting the rich complexity that simple systems can exhibit (Wolfram & Mallinckrodt, 1994).\n\nComputation at the Edge of Chaos The concept of computation at the “edge of chaos” suggests that systems poised between order and disorder exhibit maximal computational capabilities and complex behavior. Langton (1990) introduced this idea, demonstrating that cellular automata operating at this critical transition can perform complex computations. Packard (1988) explored how systems adapt toward the edge of chaos, suggesting that evolution may favor systems that balance between stability and chaos. Mitchell et al. (1993) investigated evolving cellular automata to perform computations, finding that rules near the edge of chaos are more capable of complex tasks. These studies provide a theoretical foundation for our work, as we observe that models trained on rules with higher complexity exhibit greater intelligence in downstream tasks.	15	{"length": 2307, "index": 15}

This occurs most densely in Lolita’s Foreword, which is a collage of possible readerly postures. Caught in Nabokov’s web, it is easy to forget that many of those postures, such as the desire for social workers and educators to be more vigilant protectors of children, are reasonable and easy to accept. But it is John Ray Jr’s prosaicness, his banal moral position, which dissolves in contact with Lolita. As proof of that moral dissolution, to John, Lolita is a “tempest in a test tube,” a demonstration of an act more than 12% of adult American males “enjoy yearly,” and whose author, had he come in contact with a competent psychopathologist, would have caused no disaster. So we understand early that this John’s position is absurd; we even see it quickly compromised when he suffices to say that Humbert is “abnormal” and “not a gentleman” before praising “how majestically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author.” With this front-loaded guide on how to not read the book—to merely abhor the author while delighting in his gorgeous aesthetics—Nabokov does not simply separate aesthetics from morality, nor does he only problematize aesthetics as something potentially obfuscatory towards proper morals. Instead, he is laying the groundwork for a morality that does not contain aesthetics, but is re and co-defined by its two-way relationship with aesthetics. This we see most clearly stated on page 283 of Lolita, when Humbert says:\n\n“Unless it can be proven to me… that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. To quote an old poet: ‘The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.’”	0	{"length": 2309, "index": 0}

Nabokov jokes, via his narrator, that Pnin’s sensation of sliding back to his own childhood is what a veteran psychoanalyst might explain as re-experiencing one’s baptism. But what we are shown as the “explosion of intervening recollection” seems to be nothing less than an alternate explanation to the ridiculous psychoanalytic one of Pnin’s stroke, or panic attacks—that is, the origin of Pnin’s anxiety, which manifests throughout the novel. We are told at the beginning of Pnin’s recollection that everything started with a strange chill that pervaded his body, but it’s unclear if this an actual fever chill, since his mother, who is described as a frail, nervous little person, simply looks at his temperature with stupefaction. She calls the doctor, but only after the doctor leaves—in fact, “no sooner had the doctor left” than she and a servant girl wrap poor Timofey in soaked linen, absorbent cotton, and sticky, diabolical oilcloth, the hue of urine and fever. Indeed, we’re told that these were of no avail against the branching chill of his ribs. If we envision a scenario in which sad, studying Pnin has been victimized by his mother’s anxiety of chills by being wrapped in this horrible cocoon, then the subsequent scene of aesthetic birth, in which he tries to find the key to the pattern of life in the flowers he is restricted to stare at takes on significance not as idiosyncratic fever but very real trauma. The anxious association and strength of this trauma is only magnified on page 24, when it is the “sense of being late for some appointment as odiously exact as school, dinner, or bedtime” which “added the discomfort of awkward haste to the difficulties of a quest that was grading into delirium.” It is then, in this seemingly unbearable moment, that the foliage of the flowers detaches, loses its flatness, and dissolves into a form of aesthetic bliss. And thus adult Pnin, in the park having a panic attack about missing his presentation, at every turn being thwarted by incorrect schedules and poorly placed papers, is thrust back to the source of the trauma which caused his anxiety, and his aesthetics, to germinate.	1	{"length": 2276, "index": 1}

Though the co-definition of morals and aesthetics in Lolita is not nearly so simple, that subtle act of reconstituting moral goodness appears also in the afterword, when Nabokov identifies the purpose of fiction to be aesthetic bliss, which allows connection with other states of artistic being, where curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy are nurtured. But if this gives us some vague, somewhat unstable picture of how morals might be defined as a compassionate dilution of aesthetic objectification, how do we reverse the definition — in Nabokov’s world, what defines aesthetics, and do they have a metaphysics?\n\nRichard Rorty takes direct issue with Nabokov’s aesthetics. He argues that Nabokov insightfully, if not originally, identifies psychological associations and personal history as the origin of our moral and aesthetic behavior. He sees these Freudian idiosyncratic origins as temporal and individual, and therefore not the grounds for the higher bliss Nabokov maintains as vital to fiction. But this supposed temporality, I think, is what Nabokov cleverly erodes in Pnin, allowing him to trace aesthetics in a more complex and transcendent manner.\n\nVia this superficially silly story one is reminded of Marcel Proust, of that legendary author’s debilitating and surely terrifying bouts of severe asthma, and of his at least partially autobiographical childhood character in the first volume of In Search of Lost Time. In that volume, Marcel’s overwhelming and inescapable nervous pathology leads him to cloister himself in his room, waiting for a good night kiss from his mother and, in his anxious isolation and general inability to play outside, weaving fantastic stories from the lamplight on the wall. Proust’s father was a neurologist who specialized in nervous disorders and believed Proust to have a mental abnormality of neurasthenia rather than his severe, breath-stealing asthma; thus we have the picture of two characters, little Marcel and poor Pnin, who, traumatized by an incomprehensible system which smashed against the restrictive moral and medical allowances of their childhood, birthed an aesthetic sense which punctures subsequent time.	3	{"length": 2271, "index": 3}

Though Humbert’s couching of his loss in Poe’s poem creates an air of aestheticized falsity, late in the novel, when he realizes “the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised–the great rosegray never-to-be-had,” are we only tricked by Humbert, or is there a shred of truth? And one cannot forget that his experiences with Annabelle were constantly limited by the social realities permitted by their caretakers—perhaps we can say Humbert’s constant obsession with the transgressive is a scintillation between a desire to securely satisfy and utterly destroy the societal norms which, in combination with typhus, ensured the rosegray could never be had. After all, Humbert says he was “perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for.” Here, the demoniac is not only the nymphophilic monstrosity it becomes, but, unrecognized by Humbert, also a misanthropic loathing of societal rules, compressed by his experiences with childhood sexuality, which incubates in his uniquely sociopathic mind to become his awful crime.	4	{"length": 1433, "index": 4}

Like all of these characters, Pnin experiences the moment where the mind remembers an otherworldly tragedy: “no conscience, and hence no consciousness, could be expected to subsist in a world where such things as Mira’s death were possible.” And this tightness in Pnin’s chest, this dissolutive experience, articulates on the page with the narrator’s description of Gramineev’s easel. This moment is for Pnin, like for Proust, and for Humbert, the result of an atemporal rupture in the supposedly transcendent metaphysics of prevailing moral systems, a trauma which was lodged in consciousness and yet disallows all consciousness, and which is the birthplace of Nabokov’s aesthetic tingle. Because as readers we know what it is impossible for the narrator to see — that the two dark figures on the easel, silhouettes in profile against the ember-red sky, are not the Poroshin girl and her beau, or Nina Bolotov and young Poroshin; they are Pnin, and Mira.	5	{"length": 1178, "index": 5}

Might’s well stretch ourselves.”\n\nOklahoma City to Bethany is fourteen miles.\n\nTom said, “I think we better stop ’fore the sun goes down. Al got to build that thing on the top. Sun’ll kill the folks up there.”\n\nMa had been dozing again. Her head jerked upright. “Got to get some supper a-cookin’,” she said. And she said, “Tom, your pa tol’ me about you crossin’ the State line—”\n\nHe was a long time answering. “Yeah? What about it, Ma?”\n\n“Well, I’m scairt about it. It’ll make you kinda runnin’ away. Maybe they’ll catch ya.”\n\nTom held his hand over his eyes to protect himself from the lowering sun. “Don’t you worry,” he said. “I figgered her out. They’s lots a fellas out on parole an’ they’s more goin’ in all the time. If I get caught for anything else out west, well, then they got my pitcher an’ my prints in Washington. They’ll sen’ me back. But if I don’t do no crimes, they won’t give a damn.”\n\n“Well, I’m a-scairt about it. Sometimes you do a crime, an’ you don’t even know it’s bad. Maybe they got crimes in California we don’t even know about. Maybe you gonna do somepin an’ it’s all right, an’ in California it ain’t all right.”\n\n“Be jus’ the same if I wasn’t on parole,” he said. “On’y if I get caught I get a bigger jolt’n other folks. Now you quit a-worryin’,” he said. “We got plenty to worry about ’thout you figgerin’ out things to worry about.”\n\n“I can’t he’p it,” she said. “Minute you cross the line you done a crime.”\n\n“Well, tha’s better’n stickin’ aroun’ Sallisaw an’ starvin’ to death,” he said. “We better look out for a place to stop.”	10	{"length": 2375, "index": 10}

In a ditch, where a culvert went under the road, an old touring car was pulled off the highway and a little tent was pitched beside it, and smoke came out of a stove pipe through the tent. Tom pointed ahead. “There’s some folks campin’. Looks like as good a place as we seen.” He slowed his motor and pulled to a stop beside the road. The hood of the old touring car was up, and a middle-aged man stood looking down at the motor. He wore a cheap straw sombrero, a blue shirt, and a black, spotted vest, and his jeans were stiff and shiny with dirt. His face was lean, the deep cheek-lines great furrows down his face so that his cheek bones and chin stood out sharply. He looked up at the Joad truck and his eyes were puzzled and angry.\n\nTom leaned out of the window. “Any law ’gainst folks stoppin’ here for the night?”\n\nThe man had seen only the truck. His eyes focused down on Tom. “I dunno,” he said. “We on’y stopped here ’cause we couldn’t git no further.”\n\n“Any water here?”\n\nThe man pointed to a service-station shack about a quarter of a mile ahead. “They’s water there they’ll let ya take a bucket of.”\n\nTom hesitated. “Well, ya ’spose we could camp down alongside?”\n\nThe lean man looked puzzled. “We don’t own it,” he said. “We on’y stopped here ’cause this goddamn ol’ trap wouldn’ go no further.”\n\nTom insisted. “Anyways you’re here an’ we ain’t. You got a right to say if you wan’ neighbors or not.”\n\nThe appeal to hospitality had an instant effect. The lean face broke into a smile. “Why, sure, come on off the road. Proud to have ya.” And he called, “Sairy, there’s some folks goin’ ta stay with us. Come on out an’ say how d’ya do.” “Sairy ain’t well,” he added. The tent flaps opened and a wizened woman came out—a face wrinkled as a dried leaf and eyes that seemed to flame in her face, black eyes that seemed to look out of a well of horror. She was small and shuddering. She held herself upright by a tent flap, and the hand holding onto the canvas was a skeleton covered with wrinkled skin.\n\nWhen she spoke her voice had a beautiful low timbre, soft and modulated, and yet with ringing overtones. “Tell ’em welcome,” she said. “Tell ’em good an’ welcome.”	11	{"length": 2230, "index": 11}

And people boiled down from the truck; Ruthie and Winfield too quickly, so that their legs gave way and they shrieked at the pins and needles that ran through their limbs. Ma went quickly to work. She untied the three-gallon bucket from the back of the truck and approached the squealing children. “Now you go git water—right down there. Ask nice. Say, ‘Please, kin we git a bucket a water?’ and say, ‘Thank you,’ An’ carry it back together helpin’, an’ don’t spill none. An’ if you see stick wood to burn, bring it on.” The children stamped away toward the shack.\n\nBy the tent a little embarrassment had set in, and social intercourse had paused before it started. Pa said, “You ain’t Oklahomy folks?”\n\nAnd Al, who stood near the car, looked at the license plates. “Kansas,” he said.\n\nThe lean man said, “Galena, or right about there. Wilson, Ivy Wilson.”\n\n“We’re Joads,” said Pa. “We come from right near Sallisaw.”\n\n“Well, we’re proud to meet you folks,” said Ivy Wilson. “Sairy, these is Joads.”\n\n“I knowed you wasn’t Oklahomy folks. You talk queer kinda—that ain’t no blame, you understand.”\n\n“Ever’body says words different,” said Ivy. “Arkansas folks says ’em different, and Oklahomy folks says ’em different. And we seen a lady from Massachusetts, an’ she said ’em differentest of all. Couldn’ hardly make out what she was sayin’.”\n\nNoah and Uncle John and the preacher began to unload the truck. They helped Grampa down and sat him on the ground and he sat limply, staring ahead of him. “You sick, Grampa?” Noah asked.\n\n“You goddamn right,” said Grampa weakly. “Sicker’n hell.”\n\nSairy Wilson walked slowly and carefully toward him. “How’d you like ta come in our tent?” she asked. “You kin lay down on our mattress an’ rest.”\n\nHe looked up at her, drawn by her soft voice. “Come on now,” she said. “You’ll git some rest. We’ll he’p you over.”\n\nWithout warning Grampa began to cry. His chin wavered and his old lips tightened over his mouth and he sobbed hoarsely. Ma rushed over to him and put her arms around him. She lifted him to his feet, her broad back straining, and she half lifted, half helped him into the tent.\n\nUncle John said, “He must be good an’ sick. He ain’t never done that before. Never seen him blubberin’ in my life.” He jumped up on the truck and tossed a mattress down.	12	{"length": 2398, "index": 12}

Won’t you go take a look at him?”\n\nCasy walked quickly to the tent and went inside. A double mattress was on the ground, the blankets spread neatly; and a little tin stove stood on iron legs, and the fire in it burned unevenly. A bucket of water, a wooden box of supplies, and a box for a table, that was all. The light of the setting sun came pinkly through the tent walls. Sairy Wilson knelt on the ground, beside the mattress, and Grampa lay on his back. His eyes were open, staring upward, and his cheeks were flushed. He breathed heavily.\n\nCasy took the skinny old wrist in his fingers. “Feeling kinda tired, Grampa?” he asked. The staring eyes moved toward his voice but did not find him. The lips practiced a speech but did not speak it. Casy felt the pulse and he dropped the wrist and put his hand on Grampa’s forehead. A struggle began in the old man’s body, his legs moved restlessly and his hands stirred. He said a whole string of blurred sounds that were not words, and his face was red under the spiky white whiskers.\n\nSairy Wilson spoke softly to Casy. “Know what’s wrong?”\n\n(continued…)	13	{"length": 1202, "index": 13}

If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language. - checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square. - checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers. - checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square. - checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.	0	{"length": 1779, "index": 0}

The proof does not explain why it is impossible for  trickster(w)  to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L. In fact,  trickster  is defined exactly to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L, so it is behaving as expected.\n\nii.\n\nThis is wrong when it says "Since  willAccept  decides  L  and  me  holds the source code of  trickster, we know that  willAccept(me,input)  returns  true  if and only if  trickster(input)  returns  true." That is wrong because there’s nothing about  trickster(input)  that influences whether  willAccept(me,input)  would return true. That if and only if only applied in the  ATM  case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language  L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how  trickster  is written, we see that  isValid(me)  returns true if and only if  trickster  is not syntactically valid. This assumes that if  isValid  returns false, then in the else statement, having valid syntax means  trickster  has valid syntax. However,  trickster  has invalid syntax even if we branch into the  else  condition because invalid syntax doesn’t rely on which lines of the program get run; just having incorrect syntax earlier in the program makes it invalid even if the else condition is valid.\n\nProblem Four: Double Verification\n\nbool isInL(string w): − for (each string c) −− if checkInL(w, c) return true −− if checkInLBar(w, c) return false	1	{"length": 1984, "index": 1}

Assume for the sake of contradiction that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know that ATM is recognizable; that is, for any word w ∈ Σ*, there exists a recognizer M which accepts w if and only if w ∈ ATM. Since ATM ∈ co-RE, we know for any w ∈ ATM that there exists a recognizer W which accepts w if and only if w ∉ ATM. Thus, since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, ATM is decidable, since a language is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are recognizable. However, ATM is not decidable, as proven by self-reference in Lecture 24; so we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption must be incorrect. ∎\n\nii.\n\nreturn isInAuplusB("0" + w)\n\niii.\n\nreturn isInComplementAuplusB("1" + w)\n\niv.\n\nProof: We want to show that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE and that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE.

We know from part 3 that this means that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from the definition of co-RE that if ATM ∈ co-RE, ATM ∈ RE. Since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, then ATM is decidable. However, we know ATM is not decidable. Thus we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE.\n\nOptional Fun Problem: Undecidability Phase Transitions\n\nWrite your answer to the Optional Fun Problem here.\n\nGrand Challenge Problem: P ?= NP\n\nWrite your response to the Grand Challenge Problem here.\n\nCongratulations on finishing the last problem set of the quarter!	2	{"length": 1752, "index": 2}

The very Self of all creatures is Mahesvara, one, whose form is all, full of the undivided consciousness “this”. The one, full of the ‘savouring’ (camatkara) of the undivided perceiving subject, of the undivided perceptible object and of the fusion of the two, in the fourth state which is to be sought first, the Self common to all living beings, whose form is all, is Mahesvara. — 1 —\n\n2. There (tatra), realities such as the mind etc., which are included in the sphere of the ‘this’ freely created [by the Lord] (svasrstedambhage), are caused by him to be considered as the fictitious I (ahamkara) as being the perceiving subject. This universe springing forth as constituted by the free expansion (jrmbha) of the supreme Lord, realities that are created as the object\n\n1 The translation refers to the most immediate and general meaning of the text of the kârikâ. The far more complex explanation given by the vrtti depends on considering the two terms of the expression aham idam first separately and then together. 2 The above note has already mentioned how this interpretation has been arrived at. As Abh. explains (see text note 2), we have here the reflective awareness of the perceiving subject as not distinct from the other subjects, i.e. of the fundamental unity of the subject beneath the apparent fragmentation; the same applies to the object; and finally the awareness of the ultimate non-otherness (melana) of subject and object. 3 Because starting from this the maculation begins to dissolve (see text note 1). 4 The text, which remains doubtful, seems to contain a double interpretation (tantra) of tatra in the kârikâ (which I have translated in a deliberately vague manner): mahesvarasya jrmblmmaye ’smin nirgate and tasminn idantâparâmarse. This would coincide with the brief references in IPVV III p. 358 to the fikâ, which evidently gave this type of interpretation: tatra iti vaiyadhikaranyena vivrtya sâmâ- nâdhikaranyena vivrnoti (i.e. tatra taken alone or agreeing with °blwge). Abh. in his two commentaries also follows the line of the simultaneous double function of tatra, which he refers in both cases to Mahesvara: ‘Mahesvara being the self, the part ‘this’ is created by him upon a substratum constituted by himself’ (thus in the first case\n\n210	0	{"length": 2336, "index": 0}

The individual subjects considered as being many are the fruit of the non-recognition of their true nature. In them action and beatitude are created, that is, the fruition characterized by pleasure and pain. It is precisely the rendering limited of that whose essence is all which is called ‘non-recognition’. And thus the awareness of a limited subjectivity attributed to multiple and fragmented realities, such as the mind, the breath and so on, is called absence of the perfect knowledge of the supreme subjectivity. The individual selves are many; in them - who are manifested as knowing subjects - Mahešvara creates his own beatitude and activity, which are themselves inherent in the only real agency. This is precisely the fruition which is called pleasure, since it consists in a particle of [divine] beatitude, and pain, since it is an infinitesimal fragment of [divine] activity. The fact that activity is pain will be explained later.\n\n4. In the limited subject sattva, rajas and tamas correspond to knowledge, activity, and, thirdly, may a, in the Lord - for whom things represent his own body (svaiigarupesuj).	1	{"length": 1427, "index": 1}
eaeea2db-28ad-4191-b93e-6c56b914b7e5	4db01744-1c33-4947-ad95-13d09cb5aae2	tatra is a locative absolute with sati understood, in the second, it is a locative depending on svasṛṣṭa). 5 The capacity for fruition that the Lord instills in the various limited souls is therefore a reflection created by him of the powers of beatitude and activity, which are, on the contrary, innate in him. They are therefore kalpita. Beatitude and activity are not a different thing from jñāna and kriyāśakti, prakāśa and vimarśa (IPVV III p. 359). 6 Abh. explains this point (ibid. p. 360) by using the example of a long serpent (gonāsa), whose body is pervaded by a single life (jīvaḥ), capable, however, of being divided into many distinct partial vitalities which animate the individual parts of the same serpent when it is cut into pieces; and also capable of becoming one again. 7 The power of māyā is that which on the Sadāśiva-Īśvara plane determines the appearance of idamta within the consciousness (IPVV III p. 361). It is a further expansion of kriyāśakti; indeed, in Abh.’s words (ibid. p. 366), it is the kriyāśakti itself in which, however, instead of samhāraṇa predominating (śakti predominates in jñānaśakti) śānyatā or niṣedha predominates, i.e. the mutual delimitation of subject\n\n211\n\nIV 4 - The knowledge and activity of the Lord, together with māyā, become sattva, rajas and tamas in the limited subject. - 4 -\n\n5. Owing to the state of differentiation, these qualities (guṇānām), which are transformed in the faculties and in the products, cannot be considered as powers inherent in a subject who is the possessor of them*. Since sattva, rajas and tamas are manifested as distinct [from the subject], the term powers may not be applied to them, in that there is no differentiation between the power and the possessor of the power. In actual fact everything is an expansion of the power(s)⁹. - 5 -\n\n6. In the Lord there is being, beatitude, activity. In the limited subject there is that, the absence of that and the two together¹⁰. The latter constitute rajas, which is pain and is composed of sattva and tamas intermixed. - In the Lord, the infinite agency, whose essence is ‘savouring’ (camatkāra), is called activity and consists of supreme light and beatitude¹¹.	2	{"length": 2195, "index": 2}

This power does belong to Siva but, as the formulation of the karika points out, it is not on the same plane as the powers of knowledge and action, since it is connected with differentiation (cf. ibid. p. 361). 8 This karika is intended to be a reply to those who want to take the parallel between knowledge, activity, and maya, on the one hand, and sattva, rajas, and tamas on the other, too far, by considering the latter ‘powers’ of the limited subject just as the former are powers of Siva. Utp. replies that this cannot be so, because the limited subject looks on them – and on all the deployment of phenomena that evolves from them and is imbued with them – as other than himself, whereas the power is by definition not separate from the subject who possesses it. In the limited subject knowledge (prakafa) etc. are not spontaneous (naisargikya) and autonomous functions, but require the contribution of other factors – e.g. the senses – in order to be performed, which are all penetrated by and derived from the gunas. This is why they are called gunas, i.e. ‘qualities, components’, but also ‘subordinate, auxiliary elements’ (cf. IPVV 111 p. 362). 9 What has been said so far is only valid, however, within the limits of the world of differentiation. Once the subject recognizes his own true nature, the objective world ceases to appear in the guise of alterity and it is then that all the principles become what they effectively are, his ‘powers’. 10 What is referred to here, as the vrtti makes clear, is the guna rajas, constituted by the presence of sattva as prakasa-ananda (the guna sattva) and by its (their) absence (the guna tamas). 11 These qualities of the Lord are involved with one another and in the final analysis are identified with one another (cf. IPV II p. 289 ya sattva bhavanakartrta\n\n212\n\nOn the contrary, in the individual self this light and beatitude, which have IV 6 become knowable realities, constitute sattva. Their absence is tamas. Sattvva and tamas – or light-beatitude and their absence – though two distinct entities, are mutually united to form rajas. In the limited subject activity and pain are called rajas. – 6 –	3	{"length": 2172, "index": 3}

Those realities which in the Lord are the object of an unconventional reflective awareness in terms of ‘this’, those, mixed and separated, are thus manifested in various ways12. The things that constitute this universe (ye caite), which are to Mahesvara—as in the case of the child—indicated by the meaning of the word ‘this’ (reflective awareness being the very essence of the light), without the connection with [or: the consideration of] the conventional linguistic expression ‘this’ coming into play13, those very things appear—since they were created thus by God—as particular realities (svalaksana°) thanks to several manifestations having the same substratum (°sdmanddhi-karanyena) and in many forms insofar as they are universals each taken singly14. 7—\n\n8. On the contrary, in the individual subject15, those entities that are manifested separately become the object of mental elaboration in the\n\nsphurattarupa ... saiva ... camatkararupa sail kriyaSaktir ucyate ... svatmaviSrantiru-pat\\fac ca saiva anandah). In the pasu the guna sattva corresponds to the satta and ananda aspect in the Lord. 12 ‘On the plane of the limited subject’ is understood. 13 Some form of paramarsa is inseparable from the pure light of cognition, as reflective awareness reactive to it, an act of appropriation on the part of the I. On this level, on which the ‘this’ is conceived purely and simply as a negation of the I (IPVV p. 367), things are the object of paramarta only in terms of ‘this’, without any other differentiations. And furthermore it is specified that this paramarsa is also free from any contact with the conventional linguistic expression ‘this’, since the word—which is, as we know, inseparable from it—is still at a level transcending every articulated language, similar rather to a silent nod of the head. An example that clarifies this is the dim and undifferentiated awareness of (and reaction to) what is other than itself and that surrounds it, that the newborn child is presumed to have. 14 See the following karika. 15 Karika 7 has defined the status of the object in relation to the Lord. But Abh. (IPVV III p. 367) makes it clear that it is not the supreme Lord in this case, since at the level of Paramasiva one cannot speak of any objectivity whatsoever, this only beginning to emerge when he assumes the nature of Sadasiva and Isvara (indeed the\n\n213	4	{"length": 2375, "index": 4}

The entities that are manifested separately, that is, the universals, are shown by the limited subjects—thanks to the power of mental elaboration (vikalpanasaktya)—as the object of inner reflective awareness through various names such as ‘jar’, ‘silvery’, ‘white’, ‘cloth’, ‘cart’ and so on. The limited subjects, conditioned by the experience of these objects, then also make themselves the object of various denotations such as ‘I am thin’, ‘I am happy or unhappy’. In memory this function of mental elaboration takes place in the wake of the previous direct experience; in the various forms of imagination etc. it is, on the contrary, autonomous. It is precisely this manifestation of a differentiation between perceiving subject and object perceived, substantiated by the word, which constitutes the bond of the samsara in the limited soul.\n\n9-10. The creation that pertains to him is not also common [to other subjects] and is dependent on the creation of the Lord. It occurs in the limited subject—essentially identical to the Lord—in virtue of the very	5	{"length": 1145, "index": 5}

Kârikâ 8 expounds how the object appears on the plane of limited subjectivity. Of the two kinds of object, particular (svalaksana) and universal (sâmânya), only the latter (cf. text note 16) is taken into consideration here, because the word, which in this kârikâ is shown as that which accompanies and renders possible discursive thought, has as its content precisely the sâmânya, i.e. the âbhâsa taken separately (see above II. 3. 2). Vikalpana is, as has been seen, that characteristic function of discursive thought that proceeds to define the object through the evocation and negation of what is other than it. In this the essential role is played by the word, as the Buddhists show by the conception of the apoha. See above I. 8. 1 ff. Many saiva texts insist on the fundamental ambivalence of the word, which permeates every level of human activity. The powers of the word, often conceived as the powers that preside over the various alphabetical classes, may lead man to freedom or enmesh him even more in the samsara. To remain within the terms of the discourse of the vrtti, they may increase the dichotomies of the vikalpa but they may also, if correctly polarized, gradually re-absorb the vikalpa in pure reflective awareness - pure insofar as it is not dualizing (the two possible ways of overcoming the vikalpa will be dealt with at some length later). IPVV III pp. 379-380 refers to some of the classical passages of these speculations with quotations from the SK, the Timirodghâta (the explicit attribution to this text is contained in SSV p. 7) and the MV, to which the SS, at least, can be added.	6	{"length": 1675, "index": 6}

The individual subject, whose nature is identical to that of the Lord, creates, thanks to the power of the Lord not recognized as such, objects in the form of the various universals, not perceptible on the part of the other subjects and modelled on the direct experience of objects that may be experienced by everyone. And this power of the Lord, aimed at obstructing the resting on authentic subjectivity, takes the name of maya; it contains the infinite number of all the various phonemes - K etc. -, it is continuously in motion in the form of vital energy, it carries out the function called ‘mental elaboration’. In this way it creates the objects internally.\n\n11. The creation of the Lord may be common or not common to all subjects (sadharano ’nyatha ca), manifesting itself in both cases in all clarity. With the suppression of the mental constructs, resulting from concentration on a single point, the plane of the Lord is gradually reached.	7	{"length": 1212, "index": 7}

If we have not read Macbeth, tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow replanted in a new text cannot recover its existential despair and thus a dimension has been lost. So as students of literature we are intuitively comfortable with not only the presence of a compact between author and reader by which unprojection may occur but also with the constant instability of that compact. Of course, some might argue, as Paul De Man does in Autobiography as Defacement, that all reading involves writing and all writing involves reading—the instability of unprojection implies the continuous individual creation and prediction of the code which the author must perform when they imagine what the reader will understand and which the reader must perform when they imagine what the author might have meant. And thus, via a lengthy introduction, we have reached our novel, and Nabokov.\n\nNabokov’s predecessors were well-versed in the process of compressing the object into the image, and even, at least as early as in Jane Eyre, with the decompressive step, through the miscues and hilarious mistellings which happen anytime an unreliable consciousness is both reader and writer, as we all are in the world. However, Nabokov makes explicit this second decompressive step, separating one consciousness into two, which he does not do in Lolita, and which enables something far more unique.\n\nI argue that the technological innovation of this work lies not in the original tale, the depressing relationship between two relentlessly neurotic men, nor the attempt to read Kinbote in his entirety, wherein we must interpret an interpretation and end up caught in Nabokov’s vast web. Nabokov does not need, or perhaps even expect, us to interpret Kinbote into an even higher dimensional space. Rather, separating the two consciousnesses enables the reader to analyze the interpretive functions themselves, the solar flare by which the puppet of Shade’s life becomes the shadow of his poem, and the reflection of that flare, Kinbote’s pale, lunar luminescence in the window, just visible in its snowy, doubled realm, by whose light the shadow has been unprojected back into the world and become something else entirely.	1	{"length": 2355, "index": 1}

This power of creation, limited by non-awareness, remains restricted to the individual sphere: what is created are images, feelings, ideas, etc., which depend more (as in the case of memory) or less (as in fantasy) on the objects in the phenomenal world created by the Lord. These two kinds of objects and of creations are distinguished by being the last ‘common to all subjects’, the others are ‘not common’, i.e. not able to be experienced except by the limited subject who creates them. But the power of creation is essentially the same. 21 The object of the mental elaboration (vikalpa etc.) is not the svalakṣaṇa, but the samanya, which is not attached to a definite time and place. 22 Or: ‘...becomes the object of the reflective awareness [‘I am this universe’] peculiar to the condition of Isvara’. The creation of the Lord is therefore twofold. On the one hand it constitutes the world of objective existence, regarding which all subjects are coordinated; on the other - restricted to a single individual - it constitutes the sphere of dream and error, such as the mistaken sight of two moons, which as far as clarity and immediacy are concerned is on the same plane as the other (cf. III. 2. 16); cf. IPVV III p. 386 aiwarasya sargasya spasṭavabhāsatvam, ata eva avikalpyateti rūpam. This interpretation of the first part of the kārikā and in particular of the expression ścīdhrāṇo ’nyathā ca is that suggested by the vrtti, but not the only possible one. For instance, one may understand, as appears from the\n\n215	8	{"length": 1783, "index": 8}

To this Abh. adds an interpretation of his own (IPVV III p. 386 and IPV II pp. 301-2): if the creation pertaining to the limited subject, or the creation of the vikalpas, assumes full vividness being experienced differently – i.e. recognizing the power of the Lord in it –, then it too becomes common, i.e. able to be experienced by everyone, as in the case of he who, being imbued with the energy of the mantras, becomes able to transform his representations and intentions into reality; in this case the pasavah sargah, too, can lead to the condition of the Lord (svaratam asya dadati). As he himself explains, the aitah sargah of the karika may be understood as pasavah sargah, insofar as also this latter form of creation rests, in its ultimate essence, on the former; if this interpretation is not directly referred to in the vrtti and fika – Abh. adds – it is only because the ultimate identity of the pasava and aisvara creation is too obvious to be stated overtly. 23 In the sense that the creation of the object is parallel to that of the subject. Reality, in effect, is constituted by the interaction of determinate levels of subjectivity with the corresponding levels of objectivity (see e.g. PH pp. 6-7). 24 The absence of the split between subject and objective reality constitutes the cardinal difference between Isvara’s creation and the pasu's creation (IPVV III p. 388 ‘bhedanudayat’ iti / anena aisvarasya sargasya patavat sargat vailaksanyam darsitam; see also II p. 329); and it is precisely for this reason that the creation of the Lord does not represent a bond. However, it must be considered, Abh. continues (ibid.), that in the pasu's creation two levels may be distinguished, and whereas the first only shows the emergence of differentiation, with the mayic and danava maculations, it is the second, presided over by Brahma (cf. III. 2. 1) and consisting in the various psychic and mental activities (pratyaya), that directly causes the karmic maculation and binds to the samsara. 25 Dharmakirti defines the type of knowledge that pertains to the yogins in similar terms: PV III. 281 praguktam yoginam jnanam tesam tadbhavandmayam / vidhutakalpandjalam spasiam evavabhasate; see also PVin I.	9	{"length": 2399, "index": 9}

On this plane, by applying oneself and intensely cultivating those moments when the mental construct becomes attenuated, which occur sporadically (antarantara) while the activity26 pertaining to the limited subject is taking place, the beings in the power of the samsara gradually attain, through\n\n216\n\nthe emergence of the state of the Lord in all its fullness, the dissolution IV 11 of the state of limited individuality. - 1 1 -\n\n12.

In the first the vikalpas were gradually suppressed by fixing the ninnkalpa (cf. PH pp. 39-40; IPVV III p. 386 avikalpakaparigrhltaspastavastuvisayaikagratavalambanena); here, on the contrary, their inclusion and transfiguration in the sphere of the totality of consciousness is taught. 28 I.e. the so-called objective reality (cf. IV.11) facing both the liberated soul and the bound soul. 29 Unlike the situation expounded in the previous karika, where the cognizable subsisted though in a state of non-differentiation with the I—a state that Abh. compares to that of the plane of Sadasiva-Isvara—, here one cannot even speak of cognizable reality, as it has now been dissolved and absorbed in the I without a trace. This is the state of the supreme Siva.\n\n217\n\nIV 15 15. Thus seeing the true reality of what is his own self and the knowledge and action that pertain to him, he knows and creates objects as he wishes. Having thus recognized as Lord his own self full of the infinite powers of knowledge and action once the signs of recognition represented by the powers have come to light, he sees and creates all things at will. — 15 —\n\n\n16. Thus this new, easy path has been explained by me as the great master expounded it in the Sivadrsti. Thus he who, putting his feet on it, brings to light in the self the nature of creator of the universe whose essence is the nature of Siva, and is uninterruptedly absorbed in it, attains perfection. Within the course of ordinary reality, in its various forms, solely in virtue of an act of recognition (pratyabhijhamdtrdt) is the state of Siva attained. This new path, devoid of tortuosity, was indicated in the treatise that bears the name of Sivadrsti by the venerable Somananda, who had direct experience of the form of the blessed Paramesvara; I have here furnished a logical justification of this path, thus causing it to enter the hearts of men. He who by applying himself intensely to this enters into the nature of Siva, becomes in this very life a liberated soul. — 16 —	12	{"length": 2179, "index": 12}

If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language. - checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square. - checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers. - checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square. - checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.	0	{"length": 1779, "index": 0}

The proof does not explain why it is impossible for trickster(w) to return false if and only if w ∈ L. In fact, trickster is defined exactly to return false if and only if w ∈ L, so it is behaving as expected.\n\nii.\n\nThis is wrong when it says "Since willAccept decides L and me holds the source code of trickster, we know that willAccept(me,input) returns true if and only if trickster(input) returns true." That is wrong because there’s nothing about trickster(input) that influences whether willAccept(me,input) would return true. That if and only if only applied in the ATM case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how trickster is written, we see that isValid(me) returns true if and only if trickster is not syntactically valid. This assumes that if isValid returns false, then in the else statement, having valid syntax means trickster has valid syntax. However, trickster has invalid syntax even if we branch into the else condition because invalid syntax doesn’t rely on which lines of the program get run; just having incorrect syntax earlier in the program makes it invalid even if the else condition is valid.\n\nProblem Four: Double Verification\n\nbool isInL(string w): − for (each string c) −− if checkInL(w, c) return true −− if checkInLBar(w, c) return false	1	{"length": 1911, "index": 1}

Since ATM ∈ co-RE, we know for any w ∈ ATM that there exists a recognizer W which accepts w if and only if w ∉ ATM. Thus, since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, ATM is decidable, since a language is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are recognizable. However, ATM is not decidable, as proven by self-reference in Lecture 24; so we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption must be incorrect. ∎\n\nii.\n\nreturn isInAuplusB("0" + w)\n\niii.\n\nreturn isInComplementAuplusB("1" + w)\n\niv.\n\nProof: We want to show that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE and that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE.

First, I’ll propose a system for understanding the work based partially on mathematics, and then I’ll apply that system to the enigmatic character. In explaining my system, I’m going to take quite a bit of latitude, but I promise it will return satisfyingly to the text, so bear with me.\n\nIn literature, we often speak about projection, which is a polyvalent word simultaneously recalling Freudian psychology and, among other evocations, the flat presentation of images on a surface. In mathematics, projection has its own, rigorously defined meaning. It is a function which takes as input a high-dimensional space and returns as output a lower-dimensional space. A plane may become a point, a cube may become a plane, a hyper-dimensional figure may return to three dimensions. In short, an input is compressed into a lower-dimensional state where it may more easily be computed, interpreted, and re-interpreted.\n\nHowever, as a rule, projection cannot be undone without information about the original not contained solely in the function’s output. One might immediately think of Plato’s cave—from the shadow alone, without knowledge of the world there is no hope of recomputing the world which creates the shadow. When we view puppets on a screen, we know there is no mechanism by which the child viewer can recreate the puppet from their shadow—the creepy button eyes, the worn skin, the players behind the mask—unless the child themselves is a puppeteer.\n\nSuch is the unique problem and the unique capability of literature as a technology. The process of writing, we might say, is a projection downwards, the satisfaction of a weighty and unstable internal emotion condensed into the single prismatic metaphor which, by nature of the word unit, has a lower dimension than a more literal explanation of that emotion. However, in reading, one is challenged to interpret the polyvalent metaphor, unprojecting it back into the multidimensional space from which it came, and thereby recovering, reproducing, or displacing, the original projected object.	0	{"length": 2176, "index": 0}

During the commentary Kinbote mocks him relentlessly, designating him into a shadowy mirror role, where he is a clockwork man re-experiencing Charles’s fantastical journey, but without any of the whimsy or queerness or humanity and therefore only as a leering joke. However, we notice that in many ways the story of Gradus is the complement rather than the mocking retelling of Charles’s story. We know from the Index entry about Charles II (page 306) that Charles travels from the palace to the port, then through Paris, then through Switzerland, visits Villa Disa, and then finally arrives in America—but other than both ends of this journey, and his brief visit to Villa Disa, we see nothing of this journey except through the eyes of Gradus. And there is evidence his visit to that Villa is nothing more than a dream. On page 206, Charles’s entry into Villa Disa has him simply appear in garlands of shade; soon after on page 210 he describes his dreams of her as both awfully tender, constantly aware of her helpless love for him, and haunted by a confession of his, perhaps to homosexuality. Her begging for him to stay on page 213, which includes the offer for him to “bed here as many as forty guests, forty Arabian thieves,” satisfies both dream requirements. And he says on the bottom of 211 that these dreams are finished by his seeing a faint smile of hers in the corner of his eye, but turning to find her not to be there. Indeed, the Villa Disa sequence closes on page 214 with his vision of her as a white figure bending over the garden table, when a “fragile bridge was suspended between waking indifference and dream-love,” only to realize that it was not her at all, but Fleur.\n\nAll this to say that it is Kinbote’s telling of Gradus that creates Charles’s own journey from Zembla to America, excluding the actual sections in Zembla and America. At the bottom of page 177, we find out briefly and in parentheses only in a Gradus section that Charles had reclined on that Parisian sofa where Gradus currently sits; later, at the bottom of page 200, we find “The King was here” scrawled in charcoal in the lavender villa Gradus both sullies and, perhaps, creates.	2	{"length": 2301, "index": 2}

Is there Odon to enable that king’s escape without Nodo to shuffle and deal the fated, cheated card, as he does on page 150, which sends Gradus after the King? Gradus, then, is the structural support which enables Kinbote’s fantasy not only in form and language, as when he slips and slides through caesuras and rhymes, but also in the crucial narrative fiber which allows us to see, and Kinbote therefore to create, his own journey.\n\nThis process-based definition of Gradus recalls Bakhtin’s definition of heroic creation through the loving bestowal of death which Naiman quotes and interprets in his chapter on Hermophobia. Bakhtin says that “memory begins to act as a gathering and completing force from the very first moment of the hero's appearance; the hero is born in this memory (of his death)... in this sense we could say that death is the form of the aesthetic consummation of an individual” (Naiman 116). Shade’s constant preterist tendencies, where he recognizes death in every sloughing moment of his life, builds to this aesthetic consummation, when the *Pale Fire* poem is freed from its earthly container and brought into Kinbote’s arms through Shade’s murder by Gradus.\n\nJust as a function is both the transportation of a specific input to a specific output, it is also a structure and system which exists outside and agnostic of any input and output. So too is Gradus both the key enabler of aesthetic consummation which accompanies each line of the poem, carries its prosaic interpretation, and enables its ultimate apotheotic release, but also is himself a frustrating, common, clockwork mechanism which can only be an enabler and never a participant—as we see on page 154, Gradus points out the right instrument and directs the carving, but never himself takes part in the infernal sacrament.	3	{"length": 1870, "index": 3}

The tragic madman Jack Grey is allowed to end, as we are told on page 299, in a gesture of humanoid despair, not a feeble splutter of clockwork. But we know from page 301, the end of the novel, that despite poor Jack’s death, our instance’s death is not the function’s death, as no matter Kinbote’s final destination, no matter the manner of his great sob, no matter the conduct of any future unprojection, a bigger, more respectable, and more competent Gradus will be waiting at the door.	4	{"length": 675, "index": 4}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.	0	{"length": 2466, "index": 0}

The last case study about Warner's randomized response model exemplifies the typical approach\nto statistical inference: We apply the rules of probability to arrive at a point where we can plug in the\ndata in order to estimate the parameters we are interested in.\nAfter having taken a basic probability course such as Stats 117 or CS 109, you should be comfortable\nto work with probability at a slightly more formal level. Such a more careful treatment works with a\nsample space Ω, which is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if you toss a coin twice and\nabbreviate H=heads and T=tails, then Ω = {HH,HT,TH,TT}.\nAn event A is a subset of Ω. In the above example, the event ‘get tails exactly once' is {HT,TH}.\nA probability measure P assigns to each event a number such that\n1. Ρ(Ω) = 1\n2. P(A) ≥ 0 for all events A\n3. P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are disjoint. This has to be also true for an infinite\ncollection of disjoint events A1, A2, . . .: P (∪∞i=1Ai) = ∑∞i=1 P(Ai).\nWith the above rules one can derive all the other rules of probability. For example, in order to\nderive the complement rule one uses that A and Ac are disjoint and that AU AC = Ω. Therefore\n1 = P(Ω) = P(AU Aº) = P(A) + P(Aº)\nand the complement rule follows from rearranging that equation.\nAs a different example, try to derive the following more general form of the addition rule:\nP(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)\nThis more general form does not require that A and B are disjoint; it reduces to the often used\nP(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) in the case where A and B are disjoint. As an alternative way of establishing\nthis rule, you can also employ a Venn diagram.\nFinally, derive the law of total probability: If the events B1,..., Bn are mutually disjoint and\n∪ni=1Bi = Ω (so the Bi form a partition of Ω), then\nn\nP(A) = Σi=1 P(A|Bi)P(Bi)\n1	0	{"length": 1973, "index": 0}

Completion bonds,\npay or play provisions, and crowdfunding are also explained.\nThe note concludes with steps counsel can take to protect\nthe interest of clients investing in motion pictures and the\nrole of security interests in the context of film financing.\nTopics discussed in this practice note include:\n•\nStudio Financing\n•\nBank Loans Based on Pre-sales\n•\nDomestic Tax Incentives\n•\nIn-Kind Incentives\n•\nInternational Tax Incentives\n•\nPublic Offerings\n•\nPrivate Placements\n•\n•\nExemptions for Private Placements\nCompletion Bonds\n•\nPay or Play\n•\nCrowdfunding with Donations\n•\nObtaining and Registering a Security Interest\nArranging financing for film projects is often difficult even\nfor experienced producers.. Unlike many other products,\nno one can really predict the potential success of a film,\nand therefore, there is always significant financial risk with\nany production.. Most films are not financially successful\nendeavors.\nMost projects will be owned by a special purpose or single\npurpose vehicle (SPV) that is typically a corporation or\na limited liability company.. These entities are created to\ninsulate the assets of the producer, any parent company,\nand the financiers from liability.. Insurance companies\nalso prefer a new entity that has no liabilities from past\nactivities.. The SPV will contract with cast, director, crew,\ninvestors, any guilds, and distributors.\nFor related practical guidance, see Motion Picture\nProduction Agreements and Documents, Loan Agreement\n(Financing Motion Picture) and Laboratory Pledgeholder\nAgreement (Financing Motion Picture).\nStudio Financing\nFor experienced producers with a track record, the easiest\npath is often to present a package of script, principal\nactors, director, and budget to a major studio such as\nWarner Brothers, with a request that they finance the\nproject..	0	{"length": 2501, "index": 0}

The film will be fully\nfinanced, and the budget will include a production services\nfee of approximately 10% to compensate the producers for their services.. Producers may also be able to negotiate\nbonuses, deferments, and profit participation.. The studio\nwill own the movie and usually will have the right to\nmake changes and control the final cut of the film.. Major\nstreamers like Netflix also enter into such production deals.\nIn this scenario, there is minimal financial risk to the\nproducer because the studio is providing the entire budget.\nMoreover, there will be a contingency line of about 10%\nof the budget to cover any unanticipated overages.. There\nmay also be a completion bond to insure completion.. If you\nare a producer with a track record, this may be the quickest\nway to fund your project.. But many aspiring producers\ncannot get in the door to pitch their projects to a major\nstudio or streamer.\nNegative Pickup Deal\nA negative pickup deal is a variation of studio financing.\nThe studio guarantees payment of the budget on delivery\nof the film for a fixed amount.. The producer needs to\nfinance the production and is paid on delivery of the film.\nThis scenario is similar to a pre-sale agreement of foreign\nrights, as explained below.. "Negative" refers to film\nnegative, which often does not exist today as many films\nare now shot on a digital medium.\nBank Loans Based on\nPre-sales\nAn alternative way to finance a film involves debt financing\nfrom a bank or third party.. One avenue is when a producer\n(or sales agent) raises funding by preselling distribution\nrights to various territory buyers and then uses those\ncontracts as collateral for a production loan.. For example,\na German distributor wanting to distribute the project in\nGermany might enter into a license agreement for a film to\nbe produced.. Financing through pre-sales can be a difficult\nprocess because there are many different agreements that\nneed to be made with buyers that may have competing\ninterests.\nInternational sales agents are a type of distributor, although\nthey usually do not own a single theater, home video\nlabel, or television outlet..	1	{"length": 2292, "index": 1}

They often learn about\nupcoming projects from sales agents who they meet at\nvarious film and television markets held throughout the\nyear.. Sales agents and buyers typically attend the three\nmajor film markets, which are at Cannes, Berlin, and Santa\nMonica (AFM), as well as TV markets such as Mip and\nMipCom.\nPre-sales require a distributor to sign a contract to license\na movie for distribution in their country even though the\nmovie does not yet exist.. By pre-buying the movie, the\nbuyer knows that when it is completed they will not have\nto compete with other buyers for the rights to distribute\nthe film in their territory.. On the other hand, if the movie\ndoes not turn out well, they have already committed to buy\nthe rights.. These agreements, mostly focused on buyers in\nlarge territories that can offer a substantial license fee, such\nas France or the United Kingdom, are used as collateral\nfor a production loan.. Pre-sale buyers will usually require\na completion bond before committing to license a movie.\nThe bond is an insurance policy that guarantees that the\nfilm will be delivered on time and within budget-or their\ninvestment will be returned.. See Completion Bonds.\nFor more information and pre-sale and completion\nguarantee templates, see Entertainment Industry Contracts\n16.01-16-2 and Entertainment Industry Contracts 16A.01-\n16A-3.\nWhen relying on production bank loans based on pre-\nsales, a producer must first assemble a package including\nthe script, stars, director, and budget.. Writing a great script\ncan take years of effort.. Once the script is ready, the\nproducer then assembles the other elements.. However,\npre-sale buyers, and directors may want to approve the\nscript, budget, and stars before making a commitment.. For\nexample, a buyer might insist that the producer hire an\nactor who has a following in their country to make the film\nmore marketable there.\nThere are a limited number of specialized banks that\nwill provide production financing.. These banks are\nknowledgeable about the buyers and whether they are\nfinancially sound and likely to pay for the film upon\ndelivery..	2	{"length": 2376, "index": 2}

The sales agent will have acquired the\nright to distribute the motion picture from the borrower.\nCompletion Guarantor\nThe bank and a completion guarantor enter into a\ncompletion guarantee agreement pursuant to which the\ncompletion guarantor company has guaranteed to the bank\nthat the picture will be completed and delivered to the\nsales agent.. In other words, if there are cost overruns and\nthe production budget does not have sufficient funds to\ncomplete the picture, the completion guarantor will step in and advance those funds so the picture can be delivered.\nThe bank assigns to the completion guarantor a security\ninterest in the collateral subject only to the bank's rights\nunder the loan agreement.\nThe completion bond company, bank, borrower, and\nsales agent will enter into an interparty agreement that\nwill supersede the other agreements entered into by\nthe parties.. It will require the sales agent to approve the\nscreenplay, principal cast, director, producer, and budget\nof the picture, and to remit all receipts derived from the\npicture to the bank to repay the production loan.. The\nborrower, sales agent, completion guarantor, bank, and\neach distributor will enter into a notice of assignment.. This\nagreement assigns all amounts payable by the distributor to\nthe completion guarantor, subject to the rights of the bank.\nAll revenues are remited to the bank and the completion\nguarantor (if they have advanced monies) until they have\nbeen repaid.. For related templates, see Loan Agreement\n(Financing Motion Picture) and Laboratory Pledgeholder\nAgreement (Financing Motion Picture).\nThe production company, which is usually the borrower,\nwill also have to negotiate various production agreements\nbefore the loan will be disbursed..

Mine is the proverbial office\nwatercooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged.. I hope\nto enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the\njudgments and choices of others, the company's new policies, or a\ncolleague's investment decisions.. Why be concerned with gossip?\nBecause it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and\nlabel the mistakes of others than to recognize our own.. Questioning what\nwe believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult\nwhen we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions\nof others.. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues\nwill evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated\njudgments therefore matters.. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a\npowerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year\nresolutions to improve one's decision making at work and at home.\nTo be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of\nlabels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its\nsymptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and\nconsequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness.\nLearning medicine consists in part of learning the language of medicine.. A\ndeeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer\nvocabulary than is available in everyday language.. The hope for informed\ngossip is that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make.\nSystematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in\nparticular circumstances.. When the handsome and confident speaker\nbounds onto the stage, for example, you can anticipate that the audience\nwill judge his comments more favorably than he deserves.. The availability\nof a diagnostic label for this bias-the halo effect makes it easier to\nanticipate, recognize, and understand.\nWhen you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally\nanswer.. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often\nconsists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another.. But\nthat is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way.\nMost impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without\nyour knowing how they got there..	0	{"length": 2445, "index": 0}

The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and\nmany decisions goes on in silence in our mind.\nMuch of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition.. However,\nthe focus on error does not denigrate human intelligence, any more than\nthe attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health.. Most of us\nare healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are\nappropriate most of the time.. As we navigate our lives, we normally allow\nourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence\nwe have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified.. But not\nalways.. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective\nobserver is more likely to detect our errors than we are.\nSo this is my aim for watercooler conversations: improve the ability to\nidentify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and\neventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to\ndiscuss them.. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest\nan intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often\ncause..	1	{"length": 1401, "index": 1}

However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I\nasked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the\nDepartment of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.. Amos\nTversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research-\nindeed, in anything he did so I knew we would have an interesting time.\nMany people who knew Amos thought he was the most intelligent person\nthey had ever met.. He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic.. He was also\nblessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use\nthem to make a point.. There was never a dull moment when Amos was\naround.. He was then thirty-two; I was thirty-five.\nAmos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the\nUniversity of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people\ngood intuitive statisticians?. We already knew that people are good\nintuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules\nof grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist.\nDo people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics?\nAmos reported that the answer was a qualified yes.. We had a lively debate\nin the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better\nanswer.\nAmos and I enjoyed the exchange and concluded that intuitive statistics\nwas an interesting topic and that it would be fun to explore it together.. That\nFriday we met for lunch at Café Rimon, the favorite hangout of bohemians\nand professors in Jerusalem, and planned a study of the statistical\nintuitions of sophisticated researchers.. We had concluded in the seminar\nthat our own intuitions were deficient.. In spite of years of teaching and\nusing statistics, we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of\nstatistical results observed in small samples.. Our subjective judgments\nwere biased: we were far too willing to believe research findings based on\ninadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own\nresearch.. The goal of our study was to examine whether other researchers\nsuffered from the same affliction.\nWe prepared a survey that included realistic scenarios of statistical\nissues that arise in research..	2	{"length": 2393, "index": 2}

As expected,\nwe found that our expert colleagues, like us, greatly exaggerated the\nlikelihood that the original result of an experiment would be successfully\nreplicated even with a small sample.. They also gave very poor advice to a\nfictitious graduate student about the number of observations she needed\nto collect.. Even statisticians were not good intuitive statisticians.\nWhile writing the article that reported these findings, Amos and I\ndiscovered that we enjoyed working together.. Amos was always very\nfunny, and in his presence I became funny as well, so we spent hours of\nsolid work in continuous amusement.. The pleasure we found in working\ntogether made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for\nperfection when you are never bored.. Perhaps most important, we\nchecked our critical weapons at the door.. Both Amos and I were critical\nand argumentative, he even more than I, but during the years of our\ncollaboration neither of us ever rejected out of hand anything the other\nsaid.. Indeed, one of the great joys I found in the collaboration was that\nAmos frequently saw the point of my vague ideas much more clearly than I\ndid.. Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and\nan unfailing sense of direction.. I was more intuitive and rooted in the\npsychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas..

Mine is the proverbial office\nwatercooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged.. I hope\nto enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the\njudgments and choices of others, the company's new policies, or a\ncolleague's investment decisions.. Why be concerned with gossip?\nBecause it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and\nlabel the mistakes of others than to recognize our own.. Questioning what\nwe believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult\nwhen we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions\nof others.. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues\nwill evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated\njudgments therefore matters.. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a\npowerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year\nresolutions to improve one's decision making at work and at home.\nTo be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of\nlabels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its\nsymptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and\nconsequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness.\nLearning medicine consists in part of learning the language of medicine.. A\ndeeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer\nvocabulary than is available in everyday language.. The hope for informed\ngossip is that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make.\nSystematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in\nparticular circumstances.. When the handsome and confident speaker\nbounds onto the stage, for example, you can anticipate that the audience\nwill judge his comments more favorably than he deserves.. The availability\nof a diagnostic label for this bias-the halo effect makes it easier to\nanticipate, recognize, and understand.\nWhen you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally\nanswer.. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often\nconsists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another.. But\nthat is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way.\nMost impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without\nyour knowing how they got there..	0	{"length": 2458, "index": 0}

The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and\nmany decisions goes on in silence in our mind.\nMuch of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition.. However,\nthe focus on error does not denigrate human intelligence, any more than\nthe attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health.. Most of us\nare healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are\nappropriate most of the time.. As we navigate our lives, we normally allow\nourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence\nwe have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified.. But not\nalways.. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective\nobserver is more likely to detect our errors than we are.\nSo this is my aim for watercooler conversations: improve the ability to\nidentify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and\neventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to\ndiscuss them.. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest\nan intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often\ncause..	1	{"length": 1401, "index": 1}

However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I\nasked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the\nDepartment of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Amos\nTversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research—\nindeed, in anything he did—so I knew we would have an interesting time.\nMany people who knew Amos thought he was the most intelligent person\nthey had ever met. He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic. He was also\nblessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use\nthem to make a point. There was never a dull moment when Amos was\naround. He was then thirty-two; I was thirty-five.\nAmos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the\nUniversity of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people\ngood intuitive statisticians? We already knew that people are good\nintuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules\nof grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist.\nDo people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics?\nAmos reported that the answer was a qualified yes.

In part A. the problem essentially\nasks given there is at least one boy in two children, what is the conditional probability\nthat both children are boys. Part B asks that given one child is a boy, what is the\nconditional probability that the other child is also a boy. For both parts, we need to\nassume that each child is equal likely to be a boy or a girl.\n\nAll-girl world?\nIn a primitive society, every couple prefers to have a baby girl. There is a 50% chance\nthat each child they have is a girl, and the genders of their children are mutually\nindependent. If each couple insists on having more children until they get a girl and once\nthey have a girl they will stop having more children, what will eventually happen to the\nfraction of girls in this society?\nSolution: It was surprising that many interviewees include many who studied\nprobability have the misconception that there will be more girls. Do not let the word\n"prefer" and a wrong intuition misguide you. The fraction of baby girls are driven by\nnature, or at least the X and Y chromosomes, not by the couples' preference. You only\nneed to look at the key information: 50% and independence. Every new-born child has\nequal probability of being a boy or a girl regardless of the gender of any other children.\nSo the fraction of girls born is always 50% and the fractions of girls in the society will\nstay stable at 50%.	0	{"length": 1615, "index": 0}

You randomly choose a coin and toss it 10 times. Each time, the\ncoin turns up heads. What is the probability that the coin you choose is the unfair one?\nSolution: This is a classic conditional probability question that uses Bayes' theorem. Let\nA be the event that the chosen coin is the unfair one, then A is the event that the chosen\ncoin is a fair one. Let B be the event that all ten tosses turn up heads. Apply Bayes\ntheorem we have P(A/B) =\nP(B|A)P(A)\nP(B|A)P(A)\nP(B) P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A)P(A)\nThe priors are P(A)=1/1000 and P(A)=999/1000. If the coin is unfair, it always\nturns up heads, so P(B|A) = 1. If the coin is fair, each time it has 1/2 probability turning\nup heads. So P(B|A) = (1/2)¹⁰ = 1/1024. Plug in all the available information and we\nhave the answer:\nP(AB) =\nP(B|A)P(A)\n=\n1/1000×1\nP(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A) P(A) 1/1000×1+999/1000×1/1024\n≈\n0.5.\n\nFair probability from an unfair coin\nIf you have an unfair coin, which may bias toward either heads or tails at an unknown\nprobability, can you generate even odds using this coin?\nSolution: Unlike fair coins, we clearly can not generate even odds with one toss using an\nunfair coin. How about using 2 tosses? Let p₁₄ be the probability the coin will yield\nhead, and py be the probability the coin will yield tails (p₄ + pr=1). Consider two\nindependent tosses. We have four possible outcomes HH, HT, TH and TT with\nprobabilities P(HH) = PHPH P(HT) = PuPc, P(TH) = PrPH, and P(TT) = PrPr\nSo we have P(HT) = P(TH). By assigning HT to winning and TH to losing, we can\ngenerate even odds.\n\nDart game\nJason throws two darts at a dartboard, aiming for the center. The second dart lands\nfarther from the center than the first. If Jason throws a third dart aiming for the center,\nwhat is the probability that the third throw is farther from the center than the first?\nAssume Jason's skillfulness is constant.\nSolution: A standard answer directly applies the conditional probability by enumerating\nall possible outcomes. If we rank the three darts' results from the best (A) to the worst\n(C), there are 6 possible outcomes with equal probability:	1	{"length": 2211, "index": 1}

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"	0	{"length": 2434, "index": 0}

These rebates are usually based on the\namount spent on production within the applicable state.\nSome states allow producers to transfer their incentive to\na third party and receive cash for it to provide production\nfinancing.\nFor example, Georgia offers a tax credit of 20%-30% for\nmoney spent on crew.. There is a 20% base tax credit and\nan additional 10% that can be earned by including an\nembedded Georgia logo on the film and a link to Explore\nGeorgia.org/Film on the project's landing page.. Production\nexpenditures must be made in Georgia from a Georgia\nvendor to qualify.. There is a minimum expenditure of\n$500,000 required.. For a project to be eligible for the\n20% transferable tax credit, the Georgia Department of\nEconomic Development must certify the project.. (More\ninformation may be found on the Georgia state website.)\nIn-Kind Incentives\nAnother type of incentive may be reduced prices for\nlocations, facilities, use of police, and permit fees.. New York\nCity, for example, provides a tax credit, free police traffic\ncontrol, and does not charge for permits.. See New York\nCity Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment.\nCertain companies may offer free products for use in a\nfilm in exchange for showing the product on screen.. This\nis known as product placement.. The producer is permitted\nto feature a company's product in the film, along with\na release of any intellectual property rights.. Sometimes,\nmanufacturers may pay a fee to include their product in\na film.. For an in-depth discussion of product placement\nagreements, see Product Placement Agreements.\nInternational Tax Incentives\nIn addition to domestic incentive programs, producers\nalso consider other benefits that can arise from taking a\nproduction abroad.. In Eastern Europe and South Africa, for\nexample, the wage scale is so low that local crew members\nand extras can be hired for a fraction of the cost of those\nin the United States.. Likewise, food, lodging, equipment,\nand construction costs can be a bargain..	4	{"length": 2339, "index": 4}

But savings may\nbe offset by increased travel and accommodations costs,\nwhich may be negligible for a moviemaker shooting in\nthe moviemaker's own community.. Additionally, some\nlocations may not offer the equipment rentals needed for\na shoot.. If you shoot in New York or Los Angeles, and a\ncamera breaks, it can be replaced in a few hours from local\nvendors.. That is not necessarily the case if you need a\nreplacement in a far-off locale.\nProductions in Canada\nCanada has been very successful in luring American\nproductions to its country.. Toronto and Vancouver have a\ndeep reservoir of skilled and experienced crew members,\nso numerous productions can shoot simultaneously.. A\nfavorable exchange rate with the U.S.. dollar may allow\nAmerican producers to stretch their resources by buying\ngoods and services for less.\nCanada offers a variety of programs designed to support\nboth Canadian and foreign producers.. A distinction is made between Canadian content films, which receive a generous\ntax credit, and films without Canadian content, which are\neligible for a substantial but lesser credit.. Producers cannot\nreceive benefits under both programs simultaneously, but\nthey may combine these production incentives with those\noffered by Canada's provincial governments.\nMany countries have co-production treaties that allow\nfilmmakers to take advantage of incentive programs in\nseveral countries simultaneously.. Canada, for example, has\nentered into more than 50 co-production treaties with\nother countries.. These allow their filmmakers to combine\nincentives from several countries.. However, each country\nwill require certain minimum local elements to qualify.. The\nproduction may have to shoot in Canada, arrange post-\nproduction in South Africa, and include cast and crew\nfrom both.. Note that changing scripts and cast merely to\nattract co-financing does not necessarily improve a film.\n"Europudding" is the derogatory term for bad movies\ncomprised of awkward stories welded together to attract\nmultisource financing.\nFor information on tax incentives worldwide, see\n_Entertainment Partners_..	5	{"length": 2267, "index": 5}

Independent filmmakers rarely attempt to raise\nfunds from a public offering on a public market such as\nthe New York Stock Exchange.. The accounting and legal\nexpenses amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nInitial public offerings (IPOs) occur when a company sells\nshares on listed stock exchanges for the first time.. A public\noffering usually requires the issuing company to publish a\nprospectus detailing the terms and rights attached to the\noffered security, as well as information on the company\nitself and its finances.. Many other regulatory requirements\nsurround a public offering.. An investment underwriter\nusually manages or facilitates public offerings.. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must approve all\nregistrations for public offerings of securities in the United\nStates.\nFor an in-depth discussion of IPOs, see _Initial Public\nOffering Process_ and _Initial Public Offerings Resource Kit_ in\nthe Capital Markets & Corporate Governance practice area\nof Practical Guidance.. See also U.S.. Securities and Exchange\nCommission - Regulation A.\nPrivate Placements\nFilmmakers try to avoid the burden and expense of\nSEC registration by qualifying for one or more of the\nexemptions to registration.. These exemptions are largely\nrestricted to private placements, which generally entail\napproaching people one already knows (i.e., the parties\nhave a preexisting relationship) rather than offering an\ninterest to the public at large.. Private investors are often\nfamily or friends, or others who are willing to take a lot\nof risk because if the script does not turn out well, or the\nproducer cannot attract the other elements needed to\nmake a successful film, their investment can be completely\nwritten off.\nProducers will need an investment agreement for projects\nfunded by private investors.. These offerings are often\nsubject to state and federal security laws designed to\nprotect investors.. An equity investment can be structured in\na number of different ways such as using a corporation, an\nLLC, or a limited partnership.\nActive vs.. Passive Investors\nA major consideration is whether the investors are going\nto be active or passive.. An active investor is one that is\nmanaging the business with you..	6	{"length": 2476, "index": 6}

Such a co-production or\ncollaboration agreement would set out the various rights\nand obligations of the partners including what screen\ncredits each would receive, what tasks they would handle,\nand how decisions would be made.\nHowever, if any of the investors are passive, meaning they\nare putting money into the endeavor but have little or no\nother involvement in making the movie or running the\nbusiness, then the security laws will apply.. State and federal\nsecurities laws are designed to protect such investors\nby ensuring that the people managing the business do\nnot defraud them by giving them false or misleading\ninformation, or by failing to disclose information that a\nreasonably prudent investor would want to know.. These\nlaws have strict requirements and it can be complex and\nexpensive to comply with them.. A single technical violation\ncan subject general partners to both civil and criminal\nliability.. Exemptions for Private\nPlacements\nThere are several of exemptions for private placements.\nIntrastate Offerings\nThere is an exemption for intrastate offerings by an issuer\nwithin that state that is limited to investors all of whom\nreside in that state.. To qualify for the intrastate offering\nexemption Rule 147 (17 C.F.R.. § 230.147), a company\nmust:\n•\nBe incorporated in the state where it is offering the\nsecurities -and-\n•\nCarry out a significant amount of its business in that\nstate\nThere is no fixed limit on the size of the offering or the\nnumber of purchasers under federal law.. Relying solely on\nthis exemption can be risky, however, because if an offer is\nmade to a single nonresident the exemption could be lost.\nIssuers conducting an offering pursuant to Rule 147 or Rule\n147A are not required to file any information with or pay\nany fees to the SEC.. Issuers, however, must comply with\nstate securities laws and regulations in the state in which\nsecurities are offered or sold.\nFor further information, see the U.S..	7	{"length": 2351, "index": 7}

D), there are several\nexemptions from federal registration.. These can permit\nfilmmakers to offer and sell their securities without having\nto register the securities with the SEC as required for public\nofferings.\nWhile companies relying on a Reg.. D exemption do not\nhave to register their securities and usually do not have\nto file reports with the SEC, they must file a document\nknown as Form D when they initially sell their securities.\nThis document gives notice of the names and addresses of\nthe company's owners and promoters.. State laws may also\napply, in which case the offeror will likely need to file a\ndocument with the appropriate state agency for every state\nin which an investor resides.\nBlue Sky Laws\nState registration can be avoided by complying with the\nrequirements for limited offering exemptions under state\nlaw.. These laws are often referred to as "Blue Sky" laws.\nThey were enacted after the stock market crash that\noccurred during the Great Depression.. They are designed\nto protect investors from being duped into buying securities\nthat are worthless-backed by nothing more than the blue\nsky.. See Securities and Transaction Exemptions under Blue\nSky Laws in the Capital Markets & Corporate Governance\npractice area of Practical Guidance.\nThe above-mentioned federal and state exemptions may\nrestrict offerors in several ways.. Sales are typically limited\nto 35 nonaccredited investors, and the investors may\nneed to have a preexisting relationship with the issuer (or\ninvestment sophistication adequate to understand the\ntransaction), the purchasers cannot purchase for resale, and\nadvertising or general solicitation is usually not permitted.\nThere is generally no limit on the number of accredited\ninvestors.\nA "preexisting relationship" is defined as any relationship\nconsisting of personal or business contacts of a nature\nand duration such as would enable a reasonably prudent\npurchaser to be aware of the character, business acumen,\nand general business and financial circumstances of the\nperson with whom the relationship exists.\n504 Offering (17 C.F.R.. § 230.504)\nA 504 Offering under Regulation D exempts from\nregistration the offer and sale of up to $10 million of\nsecurities in a 12-month period..	8	{"length": 2394, "index": 8}

Because one also has to comply with state\nsecurities laws, this section is not used as often as the 506\noffering below.\nThe following companies are not eligible to use Rule 504:\n•\nExchange Act reporting companies\n•\nInvestment companies\n•\nCompanies that have no specific business plan or have\nindicated their business plan is to engage in a merger or\nacquisition with an unidentified company or companies\n-and-\n•\nCompanies that are disqualified under Rule 504's "bad\nactor" disqualification provisions\nUnder the Securities Act, some offerings are not required\nto be registered or qualified by state securities regulators.\nEven if the offering is made under one of those\nexemptions, the states still have authority to investigate\nand bring enforcement actions for fraud, impose state notice filing requirements, and collect state fees.. The failure\nto file or pay filing fees regarding any such materials may\ncause state securities regulators to suspend the offer or\nsale of securities within their jurisdiction.. Companies should\ncontact state securities regulators in the states in which\nthey intend to offer or sell securities for further guidance\non compliance with state law requirements.. You can locate\nyour state security regulator on the North American\nSecurities Administrators Association (NASAA) website.\n506 Offerings (17 C.F.R.. § 230.506)\nThere are two offerings under Rule 506, 506(b) and 506(c).\nRule 506(b) (17 C.F.R..	9	{"length": 1704, "index": 9}

The term "accredited investor"\nis specifically defined by the federal securities laws, while\nthe term "sophisticated investor" has no precise legal\ndefinition.. Both terms generally refer to an investor who\nhas a sufficiently high degree of financial knowledge and\nexpertise such that they do not need the protections\nafforded by the SEC.. An investor who is considered\n"sophisticated," might not meet the precise definition of an\naccredited investor.\nIt is up to the offeror to decide what information is given\nto accredited investors, provided there is no violation of\nthe anti-fraud provisions.. Nonaccredited investors must\nbe given disclosure documents similar to those used in\nregistered offerings.. If the offeror provides information to\naccredited investors, the same information must be given\nto nonaccredited investors.. The offeror must be available to\nanswer questions by prospective purchasers.\nUnder Rule 506, each purchaser must represent that they\nare purchasing the units for their own investment only and\nnot with plans to sell or otherwise distribute the units.. The\nunits purchased are "restricted" and may not be resold by\nthe investor except in certain circumstances.. All security offerings, even those exempt from registration\nunder Reg..

Investors are often concerned about\nwhat happens if the producer runs out of money before\nproduction has been completed and the film delivered.. In\norder to provide reassurance, the producer will often secure\na completion bond.. This is a special type of insurance\nthat provides completion funds if a movie goes over\nbudget..	12	{"length": 2363, "index": 12}

Perhaps the worst-case\nscenario is the death of a star before completing the role.\nIn such a scenario, the completion bond company steps in\nto supply enough funds to finish the film.. Or if the project\ncannot be completed, it will reimburse the investors for\ntheir contributions.. Completion bonds are expensive, usually\ncosting 3% or more of the net production budget.. Some\ncompanies may rebate part of this fee if no claims are\nmade.. Completion bond companies usually will not bond\nlow budget films.\nCompletion bond companies are selective in which projects\nthey are willing to insure.. They want their premium dollars\nbut do not want to take unnecessary risks.. Therefore, they\nimpose many conditions before they will issue a completion\nbond.. The bond companies have experts on staff to review\nbudgeting and production, and they will make sure the\nbudget is a realistic estimate of what it will cost to make\nthe movie.. The "strike price," or "production price" is the\namount that the guarantor believes will be needed in order\nto complete and deliver the film.. This includes above and\nbelow the line costs, fringes, insurance and financing costs,\nthe completion bond guarantor's fee, and a contingency\nallowance.\nThe contingency line in the budget is usually about 10% of\ndirect expenses to cover unanticipated costs.. For example,\na $20 million film might allocate up to $2 million for these\nunforeseen overages.. The bond is usually issued right\nbefore production commences because a lot of documents\nand approvals need to be secured.. The bond company\nrequires signed contracts with the director and the stars\nfirmly committing them to perform in the movie.. An actor\nexpressing interest in the film is not the same as one\nsigning a binding contract.. If the production is funded in\npart by a bank loan, the bank will not disburse the funds\nuntil the completion bond company issues the bond..	13	{"length": 2042, "index": 13}

Stars may also have\nto submit to a medical exam.\nIn the event the bond company agrees to bond the film, it\nis given extraordinary powers.. The bond company can fire\nthe director if they go over budget.. The bond company is\nliable for overages, so if a director is taking more time than\nexpected, the director can be replaced.\nThis process of packaging a project can be intense for\nthe producer because so many deals need to be finalized\nquickly.. What happens if the producer signs a deal with a\nstar and guarantees a $1,000,000 fee with a start date of\nJuly 1, and then is unable to secure a co-star, director, or\nother essential element of the package?. The producer could\nlose the star, have to pay the fee, and then need to restart\nthe process.\nPay or Play\nMovie stars usually will not agree to perform in a film\nwithout the producer committing to pay them on a pay\nor play basis.. This means they get paid even if the project\ndoes not go into production, provided they are not in\ndefault.. If you are a star like George Clooney, you are\noffered dozens of projects every year.. Even an actor who is\na workaholic only has time to perform in a few movies each\nyear because each one takes several months to shoot, with\nadditional rehearsal and post-production time.\nThus, if you offer Margot Robbie a role in your movie,\nand she wants to do it, she will not firmly commit to it\nuntil you give her a start date and a pay or play guarantee\nthat she will be paid her fee regardless of whether or\nnot you actually commence production.. This is because\nMargot Robbie knows once she signs a contract with you,\nif the next day she is offered the role of a lifetime in a\nmovie about something she cares deeply about, she will\nhave to turn that job down..	14	{"length": 2368, "index": 14}

Moreover, if you\nare an independent producer, you will likely have to make\na substantial deposit in an escrow account for her to sign\na contract.. If she is contracting with a major studio, she\nmight not require this, but for an independent producer,\nher agents may insist on a deposit.. Stars may also require\napproval over the selection of the director, co-star, and any\nscript changes.\nFor further information, see Entertainment Industry\nContracts P 16A.01-16A.02.\nCrowdfunding with\nDonations\nCrowdfunding refers to the process of raising money\nto fund a project or business through numerous small\ncontributors, often using an online platform or funding\nportal to solicit investment.. Because investing in film is\nsuch a risky endeavor, being able to spread that risk among\nmany people may substantially increase the amount of\nfinancing available for a film.. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (Pub.. L.. No.. 115-97), crowdfunding could only\nbe accomplished by seeking donations.. Web portals such\nas Kickstarter and Indiegogo could help filmmakers raise\nsuch donations.. While those who made a donation could\nnot share in any profits, they might receive certain benefits,\nsuch as a screen credit on the film, a poster, t-shirts, or\nother "swag."\nCrowdfunding Investments\nWith passage of the JOBS Act, promoters are now able\nto offer a share of the profits in a project.. This will likely\nencourage small investors who want to participate in film\nor other start-up businesses, but can only afford to make a\nmodest investment.\nFunding portals are platforms that provide investors\nwith information about investments being offered.. These\nportals are designed to allow internet-based platforms or\nintermediaries to facilitate the offer and sale of securities\nwithout having to register with the SEC as brokers.. Portals\nare required to register with the commission and become\na member of a national securities association, currently\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.. (FINRA).\nFINRA is an independent, nongovernmental regulator for all\nsecurities firms doing business with the public in the United.	15	{"length": 2358, "index": 15}

Joint distributions arise naturally in many\napplications, of which the following are illustrative:\n• In ecological studies, counts of several species, modeled as random variables, are\noften made. One species is often the prey of another; clearly, the number of predators\nwill be related to the number of prey.\n• The joint probability distribution of the x, y, and z components of wind velocity\ncan be experimentally measured in studies of atmospheric turbulence.\n• The joint distribution of the values of various physiological variables in a population\nof patients is often of interest in medical studies.\n• A model for the joint distribution of age and length in a population of fish can be used\nto estimate the age distribution from the length distribution. The age distribution is\nrelevant to the setting of reasonable harvesting policies.\nThe joint behavior of two random variables, X and Y, is determined by the\ncumulative distribution function\nF(x, y) = P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y)\nregardless of whether X and Y are continuous or discrete. The cdf gives the probability\nthat the point (X, Y) belongs to a semi-infinite rectangle in the plane, as shown in\nFigure 3.1. The probability that (X, Y) belongs to a given rectangle is, from Figure 3.2,\nP(x1 < X ≤ x2, y1 < Y ≤ y2) = F(x2, y2) – F(x2, y1) – F(x1, y2)\n+ F(x1, y1)\n71	0	{"length": 1493, "index": 0}

TechCrunch reported today that Schiffmann raised $2.5 million at a $50 million valuation. Schiffmann confirmed to 404 Media he raised close to $2.5 million.\n\n“It's real! Premium domains are expensive, but it's worth it,” Schiffman told me in an email after I reached out to ask if it was true. He also provided me with a screenshot of the transaction on Escrow.com, an online escrow service to buy and sell asserts, which shows he paid $1,887,843 for the domain on February 6.	0	{"length": 1055, "index": 0}

In general, if X1, ..., Xn are jointly distributed random variables, their\njoint cdf is\nF(x1, x2,..., xn) = P(X1 ≤ X1, X2 ≤ X2,..., Xn ≤ Xn)\nTwo- and higher-dimensional versions of density functions and frequency func-\ntions exist. We will start with a detailed description of such functions for the discrete\ncase, since it is the easier one to understand.\n3.2 Discrete Random Variables\nSuppose that X and Y are discrete random variables defined on the same sample\nspace and that they take on values X1, X2, ..., and y1, y2, ..., respectively. Their\njoint frequency function, or joint probability mass function, p(x, y), is\np(xi, yj) = P(X = Xi, Y = yj)\nA simple example will illustrate this concept. A fair coin is tossed three times; let X\ndenote the number of heads on the first toss and Y the total number of heads.

Note that the probabilities\nin the preceding table sum to 1.\nSuppose that we wish to find the frequency function of Y from the joint frequency\nfunction. This is straightforward:\npy(0) = P(Y = 0)\n= P(Y = 0, X = 0) + P(Y = 0, X = 1)\n1\n-+0\n8\n1\n18\npy(1) = P(Y = 1)\n= P(Y = 1, X = 0) + P(Y = 1, X = 1)\n=\n3-8\nIn general, to find the frequency function of Y, we simply sum down the appropriate\ncolumn of the table. For this reason, py is called the marginal frequency function\nof Y. Similarly, summing across the rows gives\nPx(x) = ∑ p(x, yi)\ni\nwhich is the marginal frequency function of X.\nThe case for several random variables is analogous. If X1, ..., Xm are discrete\nrandom variables defined on the same sample space, their joint frequency function is\np(x1,..., Xm) = P(X₁ = X1,..., Xm = Xm)\nThe marginal frequency function of X1, for example, is\nPx₁ (x1) = ∑ P(X1, X2, ..., Xm)\nX2Xm\nThe two-dimensional marginal frequency function of X₁ and X2, for example, is\nPX1X2 (X1, X2) = ∑ P(X1, X2, ..., Xm)\nX3Xm\nEXAMPLE A Multinomial Distribution\nThe multinomial distribution, an important generalization of the binomial distribution,\narises in the following way.

This formidable algebraic task can be avoided,\nhowever, by noting that N; can be interpreted as the number of successes in n trials,\neach of which has probability p₁ of success and 1 pi of failure. Therefore, N; is a\nbinomial random variable, and\nn\nPN; (ni)\nni\n=\np (1\nPi)n-ni\nni\nThe multinomial distribution is applicable in considering the probabilistic prop-\nerties of a histogram. As a concrete example, suppose that 100 independent ob-\nservations are taken from a uniform distribution on [0, 1], that the interval [0, 1] is\npartitioned into 10 equal bins, and that the counts n₁, . . ., N 10 in each of the 10 bins are\nrecorded and graphed as the heights of vertical bars above the respective bins.

Convey a clearly defined\nproduct vision in a way that captures attention and creates a credible plan that compels others\nto action.\n\nFinally, having the ability to combine an understanding of the problem space with a technical\nand business understanding of the options available to address it, and synthesize them into\ncredible solutions. Ability to articulate the solutions across a range of detail depending on the\naudience.\n\n[Sample Questions]\n• How would you improve restaurant search?\n• If you were to build the next great feature for Google Search, what would it be?\n• How would you improve Google Maps?\n• How would you design an alarm clock for a person with a visual impairment?\n\n2. Strategic Insights\nBy incorporating and applying one's understanding of the customer, competitive intelligence,\nexternal trends, and data from lagging/leading metrics, Google's Product Managers can\nsuccessfully establish or adapt strategies. They are able to account for how different strategies\nand decisions impact results of a given product. This could include defining short- and\nlong-term monetization or cost savings opportunities, customer choices/options, and pricing\nstrategies.\n\n[Sample Questions]\n• How would you grow [a certain product] product?\n• Should Google offer a StubHub competitor? That is, sell sports, concert, and theater\ntickets?\n• How would you monetize [a certain product] more effectively?\n\n3. Analytical\nGoogle Product Managers demonstrate an understanding of challenges facing a product,\nabsorbs relevant information, and develops opinionated perspective.

C.. Huang\nPeople's University of China\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nExisting theories of governance generally focus on formal institutions, con-\nceptualized in an either-or binary of state versus society.. Recent archival\nresearch, however, has demonstrated that local Chinese administrative prac-\ntice drew widely on semiformal governance through the use of quasi officials\nnominated by communities.. They were not salaried and generated little or no\npaperwork.. Once confirmed by the magistrate, they were largely left to func-\ntion on their own; the county yamen intervened only after complaints or in\ndisputes.. That mode of administrative practice was born of adaptations, by a\nhighly centralized government that aimed to be as minimalist as possible, to\nthe demands for expanded governance that came with a growing population.\nSubstantial aspects of that legacy from imperial China have persisted through\nthe Republic, the Mao Zedong period, and the present reform era..	0	{"length": 2189, "index": 0}

Disputes over land, debt, inheritance, and marriage (and old-age\nsupport for one's parents) were deemed to be "minor," first, because in the\nstate's eyes, offenses related to such questions were much less important\nthan criminal acts (and warranted no punishment or only light punishment),\nand, less obviously, because the state thought that such matters were best\nhandled by societal (i.e., community and kin group) mechanisms for dis-\npute resolution rather than by the courts.. Most disputes were in fact\nresolved by community or kin mediation.\nNevertheless, many disputes concerning minor matters could not be\nresolved by such means and were taken to court.. The state would then rely\nfirst on a semiformal process in which the court system would operate along-\nside the societal mediation that was usually reenergized on the filing of a com-\nplaint.. The liaison between the two systems was provided mainly by the xiangbao,\nan unsalaried quasi official nominated by the local community and confirmed\nby the state..	1	{"length": 2490, "index": 1}

If such extrajudicial mediation succeeded, the magistrate would\nalmost always prefer it to any possible court action.\nThe semiformal process involving quasi-official intermediaries and\ninteractions between the court system and societal mediation was used so\nwidely as to be routine, almost institutionalized.. It resolved perhaps 40 per-\ncent of the total "minor matters" cases filed with the courts.. The magistrate\nwould hold a formal court session to adjudicate a dispute only after both the\ninformal and semiformal processes had failed (Huang, 1993a; also see\nHuang, 1996: chap.. 5).\nThat basic approach to governance of acting only after complaints and\nof relying as much as possible on informal and semiformal processes-was\napplied, it turns out, not only in the civil justice system but also widely\nthroughout Qing local administration..

They\nreveal the pivotal role of the xiangbao, each of whom oversaw tax collection\nand judicial affairs in an average of twenty villages (in this county of some\nnine hundred villages).. These xiangbao-unsalaried quasi officials who were\nnominated by and drawn from local society and then confirmed by the state-\nserved as the main liaisons between the county magistrate's yamen and their\ncommunity.. They were Janus faced, at once representatives of society and\nagents of the state.. They might be the truly powerful leaders of local society\nor just buffers to protect the powerful from state demands; they might be\nadvocates of societal interests or abusers of local society who exploited\ntheir state connections for personal gain.. Some xiangbao did little more than\ndeliver messages and information from and to the county yamen, while\nothers wielded considerable influence, even settling disputes on their own author-\nity.. Much depended on the local situation and each xiangbao's personality (on tax\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 12 Modern China\ncollection, see Huang, 1985: 224-31; on judicial administration, see Huang,\n1996: 127-31).\nWe know these things not from any paperwork on bureaucratic adminis-\ntrative routines but rather mainly from “cases” involving the appointments\nof xiangbao and complaints against them.. The Baodi archives include\nninety-nine cases regarding the appointment or reappointment of xiangbao\nthat span the years 1830 to 1910,¹ sometimes revealing the jockeying\namong local individuals for the post and sometimes the opposite, as indi-\nviduals did everything possible to avoid being named to it.. Indeed, in\nnumerous cases nominated xiangbao or existing xiangbao ran away, and\none man even repeatedly paid his would-be nominator extortionate fees to\nkeep himself from being nominated (Huang, 1985: 228)..	3	{"length": 2492, "index": 3}

The record is particu-\nlarly full, for example, on one Tian Kui, who had been removed from office\nfor abuse and then several years later, in 1814, again faced multiple com-\nplaints from local leaders when he attempted to get himself reinstated\n(Baodi xian dang'an, 87, 1814, 12.4; discussed in Huang, 1985: 229).\nAnother xiangbao had been handpicked and installed again and again by a\nbig landlord named Dong Weizeng, who owned 20,000 mu and had relied\non this xiangbao to evade paying taxes on his land.. The case came to court\nin 1896 when other local elites joined together to bring a complaint against\nDong and his xiangbao (Baodi xian dang'an, 94, 1896, 5; 1898, 2; 1898,\n7.15; also see Huang, 1985: 230).\nSuch records enable us to form our picture of the xiangbao.. Records of\nroutine lawsuits of the county yamen, by contrast, give us only faceless\nxiangbao, ordered by the magistrate in boilerplate language to "look into the\nmatter" or "investigate and report." From the cases and disputes involving the\nxiangbao themselves, we have learned about individual xiangbao-who they\nwere, what they did, and the kinds of conflicts in which they were involved.\nBut past scholarship, including my own, has not yet unearthed from such\nmaterials the distinctive method of governmental administration that is our\nfocus here.. In the absence of formal complaints, the xiangbao were left to\noperate on their own, free of official supervision and formal paperwork.\nThey therefore figure little in the routine documentation of the county\nyamen.. Substantial records were generated only when the magistrate was\nbrought in because of a complaint against the xiangbao or because of a\nxiangbao's resignation or nomination..

The intent was to maintain the system with a\nminimum of bureaucratic effort.\nAs I have shown elsewhere with regard to "civil" lawsuits, the Qing\nmagistrate had little inclination to engage in protracted mediation at court\nto work out voluntary compromises among those whom he saw as lowly\npeople.. It took much more time and effort to get the two sides to make vol-\nuntary concessions than it did to adjudicate or decide a case outright.2 And\ngiven the state's approach to "minor matters" as difficulties that it would\nprefer to see society resolve on its own, generally disputes persisted down\nto a formal court session with the magistrate only after both parties had dug\nin their heels and had refused to make the kinds of compromises that soci-\netal mediators had urged on them.. Such stubborn cases could rarely be\nresolved easily by magisterial moralizing, no matter how earnest or lofty.. In\npractice, administrative expediency, if nothing else, dictated that the mag-\nistrate arrive at a clear-cut resolution of the matter (Huang, 1996; 2006a)—\nan observation no less true of cases involving complaints against the\nxiangbao than of general civil disputes.\nYet such practicalities did not prevent magistrates from continuing to rep-\nresent themselves in their writings or their published case samples in terms of\nthe Confucian ideal, as someone who governed by moral example and moral\nsuasion.. And it is really because of those ideological representations that\nsome scholars came to see the magistrate as a moralizing mediator at court.3\nIn fact, most magistrates were careerist bureaucrats who, when confronted\nwith otherwise irresolvable disputes, opted for speedy adjudications.. Most,\nduring their relatively brief tenure at a given locale, tried to interfere as little\nas possible and not rock the boat-in other words, they relied as much as they\ncould on informal societal mechanisms and semiformal governance.\nThe Republican Shunyi Example\nIn the Republican period, the Chinese state unquestionably sought to\nexpand its power in a manner commonly associated with “modern state\nmaking" or "bureaucratization" (discussed in more detail below)..	5	{"length": 2446, "index": 5}

This important bureaucratizing step came after the reforms\nthat had begun in the New Policy period of the last decade of the Qing, when\nthe state tried to tighten its grasp on rural society by establishing the quasi-\nofficial position of village head (cunzhang) at the level of the natural village\nrather than at the supra-village level as in the earlier xiangbao.\nNevertheless, alongside such twentieth-century bureaucratizing "state making,"\nmuch still remained of the old minimalist approach to grassroots governance.\nHere, as with the Qing, our source of information is mainly paperwork that\nwas generated only when the new village heads were appointed or dismissed\nor were made the object of complaints.. One notable batch of such materials\ncomes from Shunyi county in Hebei, involving a total of eighty-eight petitions\nabout village heads filed with the Shunyi county government in the years 1929\nto 1931.. Of those, seventy were from existing or nominated village heads who\nasked to be allowed to resign (Shunyi xian dang'an, 3:42 and 50, 1929.1–12;\n3:170, 1930.9-1931.9).. Six others were complaints against abuses by existing\nvillage heads, mainly in connection with their handling of taxes.. The remain-\nder consisted of five petitions submitted by other village leaders to nominate\na new village head, five reporting deaths of village heads and the need for a\nnew appointment, and two odd cases.4\nThese records tell us that the method of administration revealed in the\nBaodi records about the xiangbao was still commonly used in village gov-\nernance.. Like the xiangbao, each village head was nominated by local nota-\nbles and confirmed by the county magistrate..	6	{"length": 2142, "index": 6}

The new state wanted to reach directly\ninto natural villages through the village head, whereas the Qing state had\nattempted in Baodi county to exert its power via the xiangbao (overseeing,\nas noted above, about twenty villages each)..

Some used the excuse of old age and infirmity or\npoor health, others pled illiteracy or inadequate ability or qualifications,\nand still others pointed to outside responsibilities and obligations.. In sev-\neral instances, a newly nominated village head turned right around to nom-\ninate someone else, who in turn submitted a petition insisting that the one\nnominated first was the better qualified for the honor.. Many of the peti-\ntioners begging off from service as village heads referred to the increased\nburdens of the office in connection with the new taxes, and several men-\ntioned the military requisitions.\nThese materials confirm that village governance under the Guomindang in\nmany respects changed little from that shown in the Qing Baodi archives..	7	{"length": 2413, "index": 7}

The new\nvillage heads, moreover, were to serve as unsalaried quasi officials, just as the\nxiangbao had been.. And also like the xiangbao, village heads so chosen were\nleft to carry out their functions essentially on their own so long as tax expec-\ntations were met, until and unless they became targets of complaints or until\nthey tried to resign or asked to be replaced.. Thus, complaints against them\nand petitions from them are our main source of information about them.\nFor the 1930s and early 1940s, the oral histories of Japanese Mantetsu\n(South Manchurian Railway Company) field researchers both substanti-\nate and flesh out the archival records.. Thus, the six North China villages\nsurveyed by Mantetsu researchers from 1939 to 1942 illustrate in con-\ncrete detail three patterns resulting from this minimalist approach to vil-\nlage governance.. From oral histories, and not from the county archives,\nwe know that in Houxiazhai and Lengshuigou in northwest Shandong,\nearlier village heads, who had been nominated by community leaders,\nlargely continued to serve through the 1930s and early 1940s..

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face!

For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now!

Income-related differences in CVD\nmortality, followed by cancer mortality, in the individuals aged\n60 to 69 years contributed the most to the life expectancy gap.\nDifferences in life expectancy by income percentiles in Norway\nwere similar to differences observed in the United States, al-\nthough life expectancy was higher in Norway in the lower to\nmiddle part of the income distribution.\nTo construct comparable US and Norwegian study popu-\nlations, individuals with no income or income solely from dis-\nability benefits and other transfers were excluded from both\npopulations.. The share of excluded individuals and excluded\ndeaths were of similar magnitude in both countries.. The com-\nparison using absolute vs relative income suggests that the dif-\nference in life expectancy between Norway and the United\nStates in the lower to middle part of the income distribution\nmight be partly explained by higher absolute income among\nthe individuals in low-income percentiles in Norway.. It has\nbeen argued that relative, rather than absolute, income is most\nimportant for health.. 27 However, the findings of this study pro-\nvide support for absolute income being relevant in interna-\ntional comparison studies..

In the United States there was\nno apparent increase in life expectancy for individuals in\nthe lowest income quartile from 2001 to 2014.¹ In contrast,\nin Norway, there was an increase in life expectancy for men\nin the lowest income quartile from 2010 to 2015 but not for\nwomen.. Smoking contributed to higher mortality in low-\nincome men and women.5 However, the 3-decade lag in the\nsmoking epidemic for women compared with men29 may\nhave contributed to increasing mortality rates for smoking-\nrelated causes of death for women in the lowest income\nquartile from 2005 to 2015 and, hence, the lack of increase in\nlife expectancy for these women.. 30\nThe contribution of lung cancer, other cancers, respira-\ntory disease, and CVD to differences in life expectancy be-\ntween high- and low-income groups points to smoking as a con-\ntributing risk factor.. Dementia (including Alzheimer disease),\nwhich showed similar trends by income quartile as deaths from\nlung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has\nbeen found to be associated with smoking.25 However, only\nabout 20% of the income-related differences in life expес-\ntancy were attributed to smoking in this study.. Similar esti-\nmates of the contribution of smoking to income-related dif-\nferences in life expectancy were found for Norway from 1995\nto 2007 in a 2019 Nordic study.5\nThis study has several strengths.. The use of record link-\nage at the individual level with nearly complete coverage of\nthe Norwegian population with causes of death, over an ex-\ntensive time period, allowed analyses and comparisons of dif-\nferent subgroups and investigations of consequences of meth-\nodological choices.\nLimitations\nThis study had several limitations.. First, national tax rec-\nords do not capture undeclared income, leading to some\nmisclassification.. 31 Second, the composition of the top in-\ncome earners changed in 2005 as a result of a preannounced\ntax reform implemented in 2006.32 However, by aggregating\nincome across 5 years, the implications of this change were re-\nduced..	15	{"length": 2356, "index": 15}

In particular, we will represent arbitrary (Unicode)\nstrings as a sequence of bytes and train our BPE tokenizer on this byte sequence.. Later, we will use this\ntokenizer to encode text (a string) into tokens (a sequence of integers) for language modeling.\n2.1 The Unicode Standard\nUnicode is a text encoding standard that maps characters to integer code points..	0	{"length": 2416, "index": 0}

For example, the character\n"s" has the code point 115 (typically notated as U+0073, where U+ is a conventional prefix and 0073 is 115 in\nhexadecimal), and the character“牛”has the code point 29275.. In Python, you can use the ord() function\nto convert a single Unicode character into its integer representation.. The chr() function converts an integer\nUnicode code point into a string with the corresponding character.\n>>> ord('牛')\n29275\n>>> chr (29275)\n'牛' Problem (unicode1): Understanding Unicode (1 point)\n(a) What Unicode character does chr(0) return?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(b) How does this character's string representation (__repr__()) differ from its printed representa-\ntion?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(c) What happens when this character occurs in text?. It may be helpful to play around with the\nfollowing in your Python interpreter and see if it matches your expectations:\n>>> chr(0)\n>>> print(chr(0))\n>>> "this is a test" + chr(0) + "string"\n>>> print("this is a test" + chr(0) + "string")\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n2.2 Unicode Encodings\nWhile the Unicode standard defines a mapping from characters to code points (integers), it's impractical to\ntrain tokenizers directly on Unicode codepoints, since the vocabulary would be prohibitively large (around\n150K items) and sparse (since many characters are quite rare).. Instead, we'll use a Unicode encoding, which\nconverts a Unicode character into a sequence of bytes.. The Unicode standard itself defines three encodings:\nUTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, with UTF-8 being the dominant encoding for the Internet (more than 98%\nof all webpages).\nTo encode a Unicode string into UTF-8, we can use the encode() function in Python.. To access the\nunderlying byte values for a Python bytes object, we can iterate over it (e.g., call list()).. Finally, we can\nuse the decode() function to decode a UTF-8 byte string into a Unicode string.\n>>> test_string = "hello!. こんにちは!"\n>>> utf8_encoded = test_string.encode("utf-8")\n>>> print(utf8_encoded)\nb'hello!.	1	{"length": 2153, "index": 1}

The 256-length byte vocabulary is much more\nmanageable to deal with..

e5df2426-007a-425b-a675-99e087ef53d1	1715cece-778f-46ce-93a7-3a59972f1c1b	While byte-level tokenization can alleviate the out-of-vocabulary issues faced by word-level tokenizers, to-\nkenizing text into bytes results in extremely long input sequences. This slows down model training, since\na sentence with 10 words might only be 10 tokens long in a word-level language model, but could be 50 or\nmore tokens long in a character-level model (depending on the length of the words). Processing these longer\nsequences requires more computation at each step of the model. Furthermore, language modeling on byte\nsequences is difficult because the longer input sequences create long-term dependencies in the data.\nSubword tokenization is a midpoint between word-level tokenizers and byte-level tokenizers. Note that a\nbyte-level tokenizer's vocabulary has 256 entries (byte values are 0 to 225). A subword tokenizer trades-off a\nlarger vocabulary size for better compression of the input byte sequence. For example, if the byte sequence\nb'the' often occurs in our raw text training data, assigning it an entry in the vocabulary would reduce this\n3-token sequence to a single token.\n\nHow do we select these subword units to add to our vocabulary? Sennrich et al. [2016] propose to use\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE; Gage, 1994), a compression algorithm that iteratively replaces (“merges”) the\nmost frequent pair of bytes with a single, new unused index. Note that this algorithm adds subword tokens\nto our vocabulary to maximize the compression of our input sequences if a word occurs in our input text\nenough times, it'll be represented as a single subword unit.\n\nSubword tokenizers with vocabularies constructed via BPE are often called BPE tokenizers. In this\nassignment, we'll implement a byte-level BPE tokenizer, where the vocabulary items are bytes or merged\nsequences of bytes, which give us the best of both worlds in terms of out-of-vocabulary handling and man-\nageable input sequence lengths. The process of constructing the BPE tokenizer vocabulary is known as\n"training" the BPE tokenizer. The BPE tokenizer training procedure consists of three main steps.\n\nVocabulary initialization. The tokenizer vocabulary is a one-to-one mapping from string token to integer\nID. Since we're training a byte-level BPE tokenizer, our initial vocabulary is simply the set of all bytes. Since\nthere are 256 possible byte values, our initial vocabulary is of size 256.	4	{"length": 2375, "index": 4}

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far\n\naway, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote\n\ngrey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.\n\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning\n\nhad sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now!

Once you have a vocabulary, you could, in principle, count how often bytes occur next\nto each other in your text and begin merging them starting with the most frequent pair of bytes. However,\nthis is quite computationally expensive, since we'd have to go take a full pass over the corpus each time\nwe merge. In addition, directly merging bytes across the corpus may result in tokens that differ only in\npunctuation (e.g., dog! vs. dog.). These tokens would get completely different token IDs, even though they\nare likely to have high semantic similarity (since they differ only in punctuation).\nTo avoid this, we pre-tokenize the corpus. You can think of this as a coarse-grained tokenization over the\ncorpus that helps us count how often pairs of characters appear. For example, the word 'text' might be\na pre-token that appears 10 times. In this case, when we count how often the characters 't' and 'e' appear\nnext to each other, we will see that the word 'text' has 't' and 'e' adjacent and we can increment their count\nby 10 instead of looking through the corpus. Since we're training a byte-level BPE model, each pre-token is\nrepresented as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.\nThe original BPE implementation of Sennrich et al. [2016] pre-tokenizes by simply splitting on whitespace\n(i.e., s.split(" ")). In contrast, we'll use a regex-based pre-tokenizer (used by GPT-2; Radford et al., 2019)\nfrom github.com/openai/tiktoken/pull/234/files:\n>>> PAT = r"""'(?:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+"""\nIt may be useful to interactively split some text with this pre-tokenizer to get a better sense of its\nbehavior:\n>>> # requires `pip install regex\n>>> import regex as re\n>>> re.findall (PAT, "some text that i'll pre-tokenize")\n['some', 'text', ' that', ' i', "'ll", ' pre', '-', 'tokenize']	5	{"length": 1835, "index": 5}

We do not\nadd an end-of-word-token when training byte-level BPE models because all bytes (including whitespace and punctuation) are\nincluded in the model's vocabulary.. Since we're explicitly representing spaces and punctuation, the learned BPE merges will\nnaturally reflect these word boundaries.. Special tokens.. Often, some strings (e.g., <. endoftext. >) are used to encode metadata (e.g., boundaries\nbetween documents).. When encoding text, it's often desirable to treat some strings as "special tokens" that\nshould never be split into multiple tokens (i.e., will always be preserved as a single token).. For example,\nthe end-of-sequence string <. endoftext. > should always be preserved as a single token (i.e., a single integer\nID), so we know when to stop generating from the language model.. These special tokens must be added to\nthe vocabulary, so they have a corresponding fixed token ID.\nAlgorithm 1 of Sennrich et al.. [2016] contains a inefficient implementation of BPE tokenizer training\n(essentially following the steps that we outlined above).. As a first exercise, it may be useful to implement\nand test this function to test your understanding.\nExample (bpe_example): BPE training example\nHere is a stylized example from Sennrich et al.. [2016].. Consider a corpus consisting of the following text\nlow low low low low\nlower lower widest widest widest\nnewest newest newest newest newest newest\nand the vocabulary has a special token <. endoftext. >.\nVocabulary We initialize our vocabulary with our special token <. endoftext. > and the 256 byte\nvalues.\nPre-tokenization When we pretokenize and count, we end up with the frequency table.\n{low: 5, lower: 2, widest: 3, newest:6}\nIt is often convenient to represent this as a dict [tuple [byte]: int], e.g.. {(1,0,w):5 ...}\nMerges We first look at every successive pair of bytes and sum the frequency of the words where they\nappear {10: 7, ow: 7, we: 8, er: 2, wi: 3, id: 3, de: 3, es: 9, st: 9, ne: 6, ew: 6}.. The pair ('es')\nand ('st') are tied, so we take the lexicographically greater pair, ('st').. We would then merge the\npre-tokens so that we end up with {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,e,st):3, (n,e,w,e,st):6}.\nIn the second round, we see that (e, st) is the most common pair (with a count of 9) and we\nwould merge into {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,est):3, (n,e,w,est):6}..	6	{"length": 2471, "index": 6}

However, the only pair counts that change after each merge are those\nthat overlap with the merged pair.. Thus, BPE training speed can be improved by indexing the counts of\nall pairs and incrementally updating these counts, rather than explicitly iterating over each pair of bytes to\ncount pair frequencies.\nProblem (train_bpe): BPE Tokenizer Training (15 points)\nDeliverable: Write a function that, given path to an input text file, trains a (byte-level) BPE\ntokenizer.. Your BPE training function should handle (at least) the following input parameters: input_path: str Path to a text file with BPE tokenizer training data.\nvocab_size: int A non-negative integer that defines the maximum final vocabulary size (including\nthe initial byte vocabulary, vocabulary items produced from merging, and any special tokens).\nspecial_tokens: list[str) A list of strings to add to the vocabulary.. These special tokens do not\notherwise affect BPE training.\nYour BPE training function should return the resulting vocabulary and merges:\nvocab: dict[int, bytes] The tokenizer vocabulary, a mapping from int (token ID in the vocabu-\nlary) to bytes (token bytes).\nmerges: list [tuple [bytes, bytes]] A list of BPE merges produced from training.. Each list\nitem is a tuple of bytes (<token1>, <token2>), representing that <token1> was merged with\n<token2>.. The merges should be ordered by order of creation.\nTo test your BPE training function against our provided tests, you will first need to implement the\ntest adapter at [adapters.run_train_bpe].. Then, run pytest tests/test_train_bpe.py.. Your\nimplementation should be able to pass all tests..	7	{"length": 2213, "index": 7}

Now that we've converted our input text into pre-tokens and represented each\npre-token as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, we can compute the BPE merges (i.e., train the BPE tokenizer).\nAt a high level, the BPE algorithm iteratively counts every pair of bytes and identifies the pair with the\nhighest frequency (“A”, “B”). Every occurrence of this most frequent pair (“A”, “B”) is then merged, i.e.,\nreplaced with a new token "AB". This new merged token is added to our vocabulary; as a result, the final\nvocabulary after BPE training is the size of the initial vocabulary (256 in our case), plus the number of BPE\nmerge operations used for training. For efficiency during BPE training, we do not consider pairs that cross\npre-token boundaries.2 When computing merges, deterministically break ties in pair frequency by preferring\nthe lexicographically greater pair. For example, if the pairs ("A”, “B”), (“А”, “C”), (“B”, “ZZ”), and (“BA",\n"A") all have the highest frequency, we'd merge (“BA”, “A”):\n>>> max([("A", "B"), ("A", "C"), ("B", "ZZ"), ("BA", "A")])\n('BA', 'A')	8	{"length": 1086, "index": 8}

But\nthis did not entitle them to dominate other Sunni Muslim states and when\nOttoman arms first attempted to overthrow rival Muslim rulers throughout Asia\nMinor, religious resistance developed. In 1502 the threat increased when the\nhead of the Safavid family, Ismail, proclaimed himself shah and quickly built an\nempire directly to the east of the Ottoman frontier. Ismail's success depended on\nhis followers' belief that his descent (probably fictitious) from Muhammad's son-\nin-law `Ali made him the true and only legitimate successor to the Prophet. Such\na claim implied that all other Muslim rulers were usurpers, including the Ottoman\nsultans. This doctrine was especially explosive because large numbers of people\nin Asia Minor were predisposed to accept such an idea. For generations a semi-\nsecret Shi`ite propaganda had taught that the rulers of Islam were all illegitimate,\nand that the true head of the Muslim community, the Imam, would appear\nsomeday to overthrow the mighty and set all things right. Ismail's meteoric career\nseemed to match such expectations, and the many views which had developed\nabout how and when the Imam would manifest himself tended to coalesce\naround his person. Sultan Selim I responded to this challenge by resorting to\nterror against those in his domains suspected of sympathizing with Shah Ismail.\nHe massacred many thousands in eastern Asia Minor and then marched on\nTabriz, Ismail's new capital. Selim's Ottoman forces defeated Ismail and his army\nat Chaldiran (1514) and occupied Tabriz, but could not hold it because the town\nwas too far from Constantinople. The result was a stand-off, each ruler remaining\nsupreme within his own frontiers. Before the battle of Chaldiran, Selim and Ismail\nexchanged a number of letters. The two of these letters translated below are not\ndated, but were probably written sometime in 1514. Ismail's letter, apparently the\nonly one he wrote, came in reply to three Selim had written, one of which is\ntranslated below. The letters were, in fact, a form of propaganda. Selim set out to\ndefend his right to rule by quoting from the Quran and alluding to examples from\nhistory which buttressed his claims. Ismail, who based his claims on heredity,\nhad no need of such leaming; rather he quotes from seemingly contemporary\nPersian poetry and appears almost casual, if not insolent, in addressing his rival.]\n1.

Now, we will implement a BPE tokenizer that\nloads a provided vocabulary and list of merges and uses them to encode and decode text to/from token IDs.\n2.6.1 Encoding text\n\nThe process of encoding text by BPE mirrors how we train the BPE vocabulary. There are a few major\nsteps.\nStep 1: Pre-tokenize. We first pre-tokenize the sequence and represent each pre-token as a sequence of\nUTF-8 bytes, just as we did in BPE training. We will be merging these bytes within each pre-token into\nvocabulary elements.\nStep 2: Apply the merges. We then take the sequence of vocabulary element merges created during BPE\ntraining, and apply it to our pre-tokens in the same order of creation.\nExample (bpe_encoding): BPE encoding example	9	{"length": 2498, "index": 9}

First, our pre-tokenizer would split this string into ['the', 'cat', 'ate'].\nThen, we'll look at each pre-token and apply the BPE merges.\n1\nThe first pre-token 'the' is initially represented as [b't', b'h', b'e']. Looking at our list of\nmerges, we identify the first applicable merge to be (b't', b'h'), and use that the transform the\npre-token into [b'th', b'e']. Then, we go back to the list of merges and identify the next applicable\nmerge to be (b'th', b'e'), which transforms the pre-token into [b'the']. Finally, looking back at\nthe list of merges, we see that there are no more that apply to the string (since the entire pre-token has\nbeen merged into a single token), so we are done applying the BPE merges. The corresponding integer\nsequence is [9].\nRepeating this process for the remaining pre-tokens, we see that the pre-token 'cat' is represented\nas [b'c', b'a', b't'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the integer sequence [7, 1,\n5]. The final pre-token 'ate' is [b' at', b'e'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the\ninteger sequence [10, 3]. Thus, the final result of encoding our input string is [9, 7, 1, 5, 10,\n3].\nSpecial tokens. Your tokenizer should be able to properly handle user-defined special tokens when en-\ncoding text (provided when constructing the tokenizer).\nMemory considerations. Suppose we want to tokenize a large text file that we cannot fit in memory.\nTo efficiently tokenize this large file (or any other stream of data), we need to break it up into manageable\nchunks and process each chunk in-turn, so that the memory complexity is constant as opposed to linear in\nthe size of the text. In doing so, we need to make sure that a token doesn't cross chunk boundaries, else\nwe'll get a different tokenization than the naïve method of tokenizing the entire sequence in-memory.	10	{"length": 2112, "index": 10}

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far\n\naway, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote\n\ngrey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.\n\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning\n\nhad sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now!

Appel accentuated the prev-\nalence of the “photography theme” (141) in Nabokov's novels and the significance\nof visual images, which, in Appel's opinion, are indicative of his poetic reality.\nAppel questioned Nabokov about the relation between his visual sense and poetics,\ninquiring whether he had studied the science of optics. Nabokov answered that\n“even with the best of vision one must touch things to be quite sure of ‘reality”\n(141), affirming that one cannot grasp “reality” by mere optical perception. How-\never, Nabokov rejected Appel's inference that his own photography theme in Lolita\nreferenced Lewis Carroll's perverse hobby of taking pictures of semi-undressed lit-\ntle girls. This definite answer prevented Appel from further exploring the theme of\nvisual imagery in Nabokov's poetics, especially in Lolita. The photography theme is\nevident in this novel, but, like an overexposed image, it loses its sharpness due to its\nown prevalence. My task in this article is, in Nabokov's own words, to “eliminate all\nthe superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision," to\nsharpen the focus and create the “final picture” (Nabokov, Lolita 125) from these\noverexposed “images.”	0	{"length": 1434, "index": 0}

Scholars have proposed many explanations for the themes of photography\nand paintings in Nabokov's poetics, particularly in Lolita. Gavriel Moses indicated\nthat in Nabokov's works the mechanisms of writing, memory, and the imagination\nare “akin to the mechanisms of photography and cinematography” (40). Karen\nJacobs suggested that a “photographic consciousness” in Lolita not only turns “the real into the simulacrum” but also performs “an elegiac function as a means of\nmarking the absence for which the image itself stands” (269). Gerard de Vries, Don-\nald B. Johnson, and Liana Aschenden reconstructed the four different paintings\nthat appeared in *Lolita* and argued that the paintings functioned “to reveal what\nis suppressed in Humbert's self-absorbed account: the sufferings of Dolly" (17). All\nthese studies provide a convincing account of the photographic and painterly\nthemes and perceptions in *Lolita*, but they do not explore the nature of these\nmodes of perception in the novel, namely, the accidental and deliberate distor-\ntion of reality involved in the artist's dilemma, the inability to see “the real”\nobject during the artistic creation.\n\nThis article compares two types of visual images in Nabokov's *Lolita*: photo-\ngraphic images created by the camera obscura and painterly images created by the\ncamera lucida. By taking up the camera obscura and camera lucida techniques from\nphotography and painting, respectively, this article aims to compare the two types\nof writing that appear in *Lolita*: writing a private diary and writing a manuscript for\npublication. Nabokov uses photography, which voyeuristically privatizes an exter-\nnal object by transforming it into a personal and internal image, as a metaphor for\nHumbert's pathological obsession. Later, this internalized image is converted into\nHumbert's subjective imagination, distorting his perception of objective reality. I\ndiscuss the analogy between the photographic image and Humbert's personal\ndiary later in the article. The painterly image, which functions as an exhibitionistic\nexternalization of personal perception and an objectification of furtive sensual\npleasures, refers to Humbert's manuscript itself, and serves as a “refuge” from\nthe inevitable mortality pursuing Humbert and Lolita.	1	{"length": 2370, "index": 1}

This idea is based on my hypothesis that most of the artist-\ncharacters in Nabokov's works are faced with the dilemma during the process of\ncreation—to continue observing an object or to cease perceiving it in order to\ntransform their inspiration into an artwork. To substantiate this hypothesis, I\ndiscuss the inevitably accidental nature of photographic images, which register\na different image of the object from the one intended and observed by the pho-\ntographer. Then, I explain how a painter depicts life from his or her memory\nand—during the synthetic visualization of the painterly image—inevitably inte-\ngrates different images from different temporal-spatial contexts. Afterward, I\nargue that despite the apparent differences between these two forms of visual per-\nception, a Nabokovian artist inevitably fails to capture the full reality of the object;\nthe artist is seized by his or her own inspiration that has been derived from the\nobject but does not necessarily represent the object in its “true” form. Such inabil-\nity to perceive reality objectively leads Humbert, whom I consider as a hypothetical\nphotographer and painter in *Lolita*, to construct his own imaginative, simulated\nworld that has minimal reference to real life. Nabokov uses this artistic dilemma—\nthe mismatch between the artist's gaze and the observed object—to show Hum-\nbert's obsessive psyche; at the same time, I investigate how the dilemma also\nreveals Nabokov's own underlying quest to display the psyche of the artist, who unconsciously memorizes specific and perhaps even random aspects of things to\nlater consciously revive them modified almost to the point of nonrecognition, in\nhis or her artworks.\n\nHumbert's Photogenic Mother, Annabel, and Lolita: Simulacra\nof Nonexistence	2	{"length": 2133, "index": 2}

Before his thir-\nteenth birthday, Humbert met an American boy, who, analogously to Humbert,\nrarely saw his mother “in the three-dimensional world” (11) and knew his mother,\nan actress, mostly through her motion pictures.. Humbert and his American double\nsupplemented the lack of maternal caresses not only with the images of their moth-\ners framed in pictures but also with “a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk\nabout pubertal surprises” (11), which might have incited Humbert to look for sala-\ncious photographs.. These photographs enhanced Humbert's imaginative power.. While looking at these photographs “with partings,” his visual admiration trans-\nformed parting, or physical absence, into tactile delight: “infinitely soft partings"\n(11).. The tactile impression gained without the involvement of corporeality later\ndevelops into Humbert's scopophilic dominance over Lolita because, according\nto Susan Sontag, every “photograph gives control over the thing photographed"\n(122) at least for the things that a photographer intended to include in his or her\nphotographs.\nThe last picture from his childhood is a snapshot with Annabel.. This photograph\nwas taken a few minutes before Humbert and Annabel made their “final attempt to\nthwart fate" (Nabokov, Lolita 13).. The image of “partings” captured in the salacious\nphotographs and Humbert's tactile perception of them are now transferred to the\nphysical parting in Annabel's hair: “And her thin bare shoulders and the parting in\nher hair were about all that could be identified (as I remember that picture) amid\nthe sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded” (13).. It seems as if Humbert\napproaches closer and closer to the body of his beloved; however, he again fails to\n“possess” that “body”—the only thing that he could possess was Annabel's snap-\nshot.. The theme of absence that began with the mother's photograph continues\nwith Annabel's snapshot.. The snapshot demonstrates Humbert's desire for the\nunattainable person, for absence.. Humbert treasured Annabel's snapshot until\nhe lost it during his wanderings; thus, he had to compensate for the lost memory\nwith a new picture: “this nouvelle, this Lolita, my Lolita, was to eclipse completely\nher prototype” (40)..	3	{"length": 2312, "index": 3}

The granular surface of reality is glossed over in pho-\ntographs, leaving only an ideal vestige of said reality in glazed snapshots.. Humbert\nfollows Cincinnatus: he projects that perfection depicted in photographic images\nonto the real world, overlaying the real world with the hypothetical perfection.. I\nsuggest that looking at the real world through photographs, or idealized images,\nis the crux of Humbert's imagination.\nIt seems that Nabokov deliberately employs photographic motifs to explore the\nrelation between reality and memory.. What is the source of this photographic motif\nin Nabokov's poetics?. I strongly doubt that Nabokov studied the science of optics,\nseeing that he did not answer Appel's question clearly; rather, I suppose that\nNabokov, being an aesthete, might have studied aesthetic theory that specifically\ntreated memory as a camera.. Among many possible candidates, including Marcel\nProust and Henri Bergson, I propose Andrei Bely (1880–1934) as a potential influ-\nence on Nabokov's view that photography and memory share the same structure.. Bely's standpoint is amazingly close to Nabokov's.. He believed that the task of a\nwriter was to be responsible for the photograph inscribed in his or her heart: “за\nфотографию душевных нюансов ручаюсь: они напечатаны в сердце” (Bely, Sobranie\nsochinenii 56; I vouch for the photograph of emotional nuances: they are printed on\nthe heart).2 Both Bely and Nabokov were drawn to this inner experience.. One could\nfind more similarities between Bely and Nabokov by discussing Bely's theory of\nSymbolism in detail, but, for now, I would like to leave this task for another work\nand focus on how Nabokov uses photography in his work Lolita..	4	{"length": 1998, "index": 4}

Then, I discuss the four\ndifferent specificities of photographic vision caused by this dual structure.. The first\nspecificity of photographic perception is the inability to see objects during expo-\nsure, which evokes the aforementioned problem of choice: to observe the object\nthrough the viewfinder, or to stop watching it and press the shutter button.. Even\nif a photographer uses a rangefinder camera to see the object during exposure,\na common technique from the 1930s to the 1970s, the photographer sees the object\nfrom the wrong angle due to the parallax error inherent in this mechanism.. By\ndeciding to take a picture, a photographer loses his or her ability to see the object\nand, thus, loses the visual connection with the object.. The second specificity of pho-\ntographic perception is the fact that the photographic image is the brightest image\ncreated in the darkest place.. I connect this contrast between the outside and the\ninside with the voyeuristic nature of photographic vision.. Third, a photographer\ninevitably privatizes the image of the object.. The object now becomes the photog-\nrapher's creation, a creation that has nothing to do with the actual object.. Fourth, a\nphotograph is an inverted image of an exterior object.. Such distortive nature of\nsimilar to how photography defines the father-daughter relationship in Lolita (I discuss this later in the\narticle).. Nabokov depicted Bely in the novel The Gift.. Bely's image emerges dimly throughout the novel.\nNabokov even dined behind Bely in Berlin, 1922.. Bely was a painter, poet, novelist, and memoirist like\nNabokov himself.. Bely, like Nabokov, proposed that art is a vehicle to personal immortality.. Indeed, Bely\nfrequently associated his aesthetic standpoint with photography.. He specifically referred to the camera\nbrand "Kodak” to show how he, while writing a memoir, wanted to “snap several times (nashchelkat')" the\nscenery, "develop (proiavit')" those shots later using his memory, and, if needed, “retouch (retush)” them:\n"...я старался быть «кодаком» и нащелкать ряд моментальных снимков, чтобы потом проявить памятью; и\nтеперь вижу, что ретуш необходим; но я к июлю проработаю все" (Bely, Andrei Bely 180)..	5	{"length": 2414, "index": 5}

Bely's debut work, the "Symphony (the Second, Dramatic)” (1902), already contained\nrudimentary ideas about photographic truthfulness and photographic memorization.. On Whit Monday\nin 1901, when Bely was finishing the second chapter of his second "Symphony," he had a chance to read his\nmanuscript to Sergei Soloviev, who was surprised by the close resemblance of the weather depicted in the\n"Symphony" (also on Whit Monday) to the actual weather of that day.. In The Beginning of the Century\n(1933), Bely recollected this memory and stated that it was not surprising because he “photographed\nthe weather" of that day and wrote the "Symphony" at once in 24 hours: “.. .. .. ведь погоду я сфотографир-\nовал, написал вторую часть чуть не в двадцать четыре часа" (Bely, Nachalo Veka 140).. Here, Bely refers not to\nan actual photograph, but to his vivid memory and to his ability to immediately transcribe it on paper.\nReferring to his memory as a photograph implies that Bely as an artist attempted to take hypothetical\npictures of an object and then to render these pictures truthfully in his works.\n2 The translation is mine.. photographic vision is indicative of Humbert's distortive memory.. After analyzing\nthese specificities in detail, I compare them with Humbert's vision and discuss how\nthe specificities explain Humbert's obsessive appropriation of Dolores.\nBefore proceeding to compare the light-capturing technique used in photogra-\nphy and Humbert's psyche, it is critical to define the word camera.. In Latin, camera\noriginally meant a vaulted room, a chamber, or a round building.. Later, this word\nwas used to refer to a device that records visual images because every camera had a\ndark room, or a camera obscura.. As the etymology of the word suggests, the word\ncamera combines two different devices: a camera obscura, which collects light from\noutside, and a perceptive device, which imprints that light onto a light-sensitive\nfilm/plate.. The camera obscura is a dark cubic device with an aperture for letting\nin light from an external object that reproduces an inverted image of said external\nobject..	6	{"length": 2462, "index": 6}
75493d5b-54a7-42f9-830f-b030523ad748	9d02430d-67a9-4557-8efc-209f0096cd07	Plato's cave, according to Sontag's analogy, was the most ancient (though\nimaginary) form of a camera obscura.. Our eyes also function like a camera obscura:\nthe light from an outer object reaches the retina of the human eye, leaving an\ninverted image of that object.. This innate inversion in the organ of vision, I argue,\nimplies a subjective (but unintended) distortion of objective reality.\nThe identification of human vision with an optical device can be found through-\nout Nabokov's literary works as well.. Appel drew a parallel between one's visual\nsense and the science of optics in Nabokov's works, asserting that “consciousness\nis virtually an optical instrument” (141).. In his novel Laughter in the Dark, originally\nentitled Camera Obscura, Nabokov himself associated the camera obscura with the\nhuman eyes, vision, and people's subjective perceptions of the outer world.. In the\nnovel, after Albinus is blinded, Margot describes all the colors to him, making Albi-\nnus feel that he can see his surroundings.. However, this sense of security is decep-\ntive, as Margot, incited by Rex, has “changed all the colours” (167) while describing\nthe furniture, the blinds, and the wallpaper.. The situation was not completely differ-\nent when Albinus could actually see things—he could not see the intimate relation-\nship between Margot and Rex.. Human vision, like a camera obscura, is merely a sub-\njective distortion of reality.. Thus, when I use the term “Humbert's camera obscura,”\nI am primarily referring to Humbert's vision, or the internalized image of the outer\nworld, whereas a perceptive device, which fixates the light from an outer object on\na light-sensitive film and forms a simulacrum of it, relates to the imagination.\nThe reason why I distinguish one's vision (or experiencing an image) from its\nimprint on a surface (or remembering/manipulating the image, that is, imagina-\ntion) is not only because the former signifies instant experience while the latter sig-\nnifies the prolonged memory of that experience but also because of the two differ-\nent processes of capturing an image in photography.. Regarding this issue, Roland\nBarthes made a keen observation in Camera Lucida:\nTechnically, Photography is at the intersection of two quite distinct procedures; one of a chemical order:\nthe action of light on certain substances; the other of a physical order: the formation of the image\nthrough an optical device..	7	{"length": 2437, "index": 7}

(10)\nBarthes distinguishes the Spectator's photograph from the Operator's photograph.\nThe Spectator's photograph is the result of the chemical imprint of the object's light,\nwhereas the Operator's photograph is a visually framed image in the camera obscura.. This statement suggests that the final picture, which the Spectator looks at, may not\nrepresent the primordial image perceived by the photographer.. The congruity of\nan image is mechanically dissected by the camera structure itself.. A mirror, which\nallows us to view an object from the same angle as the lens, blocks the path of light\nwhen the shutter exposes the film.. Thus, every picture is a result of the following\nchoice: to continue looking at an object through a camera's viewfinder or to waive\nthe privilege of watching and trust that a light-sensitive film will record the invisible-\nto-the-eye randomness of an object.\nThis photographic feature reveals the first specificity of Humbert's photographic\nperception: the inability to observe the object during the moment of exposure.\nHumbert elucidates two different types of visual memory and explains that he\ncan see Lolita only “with shut eyes.” The following description reminds us of the\naforementioned two ways of inscribing images:\nThere are two kinds of visual memory: one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of\nyour mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in such general terms as: “honey-colored\nskin,” “thin arms,” “brown bobbed hair,” “long lashes,” “big bright mouth"); and the other when you\ninstantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark innerside of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical rep-\nlica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors (and this is how I see Lolita).. (Nabokov, Lolita 11)\nIn this quote, Humbert discusses two different visual memories by distinguishing\ntwo different processes of making memories.. The first kind of visual memory oper-\nates simultaneously with vision.. It is more closely connected with the long process of\npainting and representing the image—a camera lucida—while the second kind of\nvisual memory operates with eyes closed, as in photography..	8	{"length": 2469, "index": 8}

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face!

Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now!

Humbert regards Lolita as a photographic object.. Though he is trying to see\nher, his eyes are shut, and he sees only “a little ghost” (11), a perfect “eidolon emitted\nby the object" (Barthes 9).. Every time he looks at Dolores, he is actually taking a\npicture of her, trying to grasp her gossamer-like specter—that is, Lolita: “I would\nlike to describe her face, her ways—and I cannot, because my own desire for her\nblinds me when she is near.. I am not used to being with nymphets, damn it.. If I close\nmy eyes I see but an immobilized fraction of her, a cinematographic still, a sudden\nsmooth nether loveliness, as with one knee up under her tartan skirt she sits tying\nher shoe” (44).. I doubt that Humbert's desire for Lolita is a straightforward sexual\ndesire.. Rather, it is the desire to fantasize about her.. In Humbert's own words, it is\nhis internal sin, his “delectatio morosa,” which I see as the replication of Humbert's\nlove for absence.. Humbert fails to achieve the weaker desire to describe “her\nface, her ways” in motion because of the delectatio morosa, or, if we borrow Barth-\nes's photographic notion, because of the punctum of the photogenic Lolita,\nwhich is revealed every time he closes his eyes.. The punctum, according to\nBarthes, is revealed only when the actual object—in this case Lolita—“is no lon-\nger in front of me and I think back on it” (Barthes 53).. Humbert's weaker, painterly\ndesire to describe Lolita's face and ways in motion is merely an insignificant effort\nthat "will always miss its point of effect” (Barthes 53).. This photographic specificity\ncoincides with the process of diary writing, which Humbert revitalizes “by cour-\ntesy of a photographic memory” (Nabokov, Lolita 40).. He could reproduce his\noriginal diary even five years after the original was destroyed because the most\nimpressive imagery, or the punctum, was registered in his memory.. Moreover, Hum-\nbert's diary represents a palimpsest: “First I jotted down each entry in pencil (with many erasures and corrections) on the leaves of what is commercially known as a\n'typewriter tablet'; then, I copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smallest,\nmost satanic, hand in the little black book just mentioned” (40)..	9	{"length": 2340, "index": 9}

This twofold process recalls Humbert's two kinds of visual memory.\nThe second specificity of photographic perception is the fact that a photograph\nis the brightest image created in the darkest place.. Every camera has its camera\nobscura.. The light from the object comes through the lens, leaving its simulacrum\nwithin the camera obscura.. This process resembles how Humbert perceives Dolores:\n“In the course of the sun-shot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling\nchild .... while I passed by her in my adult disguise .. .. .. the vacuum of my soul man-\naged to suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these I checked against the\nfeatures of my dead bride.. A little later, of course, she, this nouvelle, this Lolita, my\nLolita, was to eclipse completely her prototype” (39–40).. The way in which Hum-\nbert is absorbing Dolores's brightness is reminiscent of how pictures are made.. She\nis "a photographic image rippling upon a screen” (62) while the vacuum of Hum-\nbert's soul is the analogue of a photographic film.. Now, this new picture of Lolita\nreplaces the old, lost picture of Annabel.. Furthermore, the opposition of brightness\nand darkness is expanded to the chronotopical value system.. Humbert used to\nobserve Dolores from a vantage point, from a window of the dark bathroom on\nthe second floor, a structure that is similar to that of a pinhole camera.. The oppo-\nsition between the outside and the inside is intensified by the opposition between a\nflourishing garden and a tiny secluded bathroom.. One could describe it as a Hum-\nbertized Plato's cave.. This specificity overlaps again with Humbert's diary writing.\nThe first day recounted in his diary takes place in this very bathroom, with Humbert\nobserving Dolores in the garden.. Humbert's diary had registered the brightest\nimpression of the nymphet, and ironically, the original diary came into existence\nbecause of the observations made in the tiny bathroom, or in the camera obscura.. As\nChristina Tekiner noted in “Time in Lolita,” if we look at Lolita from the vantage\npoint of the whole narrative discourse, Humbert is rewriting his diary, most pre-\nsumably, in his prison cell, like his prototype Cincinnatus..	10	{"length": 2396, "index": 10}

The first\nmemory is written for his own pleasure, whereas the second is for the immortality of\nhim and Lolita.. The motif of double distortion and the doubled memory re-present\nthe idea that art represents or distorts an artist's ability to reflect on a real object but\ndoes not present the object per se.. Nabokov laconically expresses this in The Eye:\n"For I do not exist: there exist but the thousands of mirrors that reflect me” (103).\nThe third specificity of photographic perception is the fact that a photographer\ninevitably privatizes the image of an object.. As discussed before, the vision of the\nOperator differs from the Spectator's photograph because the Operator's vision can-\nnot be imprinted onto a photograph.. A photograph is merely an unintended rep-\nresentation of the Operator's vision at a different temporal point.. Thus, a photogra-\npher is the only one who possesses his or her initial vision of an object.. Furthermore,\nit is not only the Operator's vision that privatizes the image of an object.. In general,\nthe final photograph is also the result of privatization: “To photograph is to appro-\npriate the thing photographed” (Sontag 2)..

This is an apt description of the\nnovel, but we cannot help thinking that this novel is also about Humbert Hum-\nbert's perception of that girl. After finishing the novel, readers understand that\nthey should have been aware of the writer's photographic maneuvers to depict a\n“poor” model as a sirenic figure, a photographic object that has nothing in common\nwith the actual model. Despite the writer's concise summary of *Lolita* as a “story of a\npoor charming girl," the readers see not the actual girl but rather her visual simu-\nlacrum through the aperture of Humbert's eyes, a simulacrum that constantly\ndeters Humbert (and the readers of his manuscript as well) from approaching\nthe physical body of Dolores Haze. The novel itself can be defined as a photograph\nof Dolores, captured by the focalizer Humbert.\n\nThere are certain passages from Humbert's childhood that provide a rationale for\nus to look at Humbert's aberrant perception of reality. These childhood moments\nare primarily related to photographic images and snapshots, which Humbert once\nowned. They play a crucial role in the development of Humbert's imaginative per-\nception.\n\nThe first picture is the picture of Humbert's mother. Humbert's “very photogenic\nmother" (Nabokov, *Lolita* 10) died when he was three; therefore, Humbert, as he\nconfessed, did not remember his mother, and the “memory” of his mother's warmth\nwas elicited solely by her photograph. From the beginning of the novel, we can\nobserve Humbert's proclivity to create simulacra of nonexistent persons and to\nimagine or memorize things that do not exist. A close correlation between mem-\nory and imagination was proclaimed by Nabokov himself, who considered imag-\nination to be “a form of memory” and assumed that imagination “is supplied and\nprompted by memory” (Appel 140). In the case of Humbert's mother, however,\nit was the photograph that invigorated Humbert's imagination: imaginative\n“furry warmth, golden midges” were laid over “the hollows and dells of memory”\n(Nabokov, *Lolita* 10). No one can prove whether this imagined memory has any-\nthing to do with reality. The only thing that can be substantiated is the fact that\nhis mother's photograph, or her image in it, filled the sterile hollows of Humbert's\nmemory with unexperienced warmth.	12	{"length": 2416, "index": 12}

In Freudian psychology, it refers to the attribution of one's own feelings to another.  In a broader sense, it resembles the flattening of a three-dimensional image onto a two-dimensional surface.  Mathematically, projection is a function transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one (e.g., a cube projected onto a plane).  Crucially, this process is generally irreversible without additional information beyond the projection itself.  Think of Plato's cave allegory: shadows alone don't reveal the objects casting them. Similarly, a child viewing shadow puppets cannot reconstruct the puppets themselves from the shadows alone.\n\nLiterature, however, possesses a unique capacity. The act of writing can be viewed as a "projection downwards," condensing complex emotions into concise metaphors.  Reading, conversely, involves "unprojection"—interpreting these metaphors and reconstructing their multidimensional origins.  This unprojection relies on a shared code between author and reader, a pact whose stability is inherently precarious.  As Paul de Man suggests, reading is writing, and writing is reading, implying a constant, individual negotiation of meaning.\n\n**Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:**\n\nNabokov's predecessors explored the compression of objects into images (projection), and even, as seen in *Jane Eyre*, the process of decompression through unreliable narrators. However, Nabokov uniquely separates consciousnesses in *Pale Fire*, exceeding the capabilities of previous writers.  This is not about interpreting Kinbote's narrative to a higher dimension, but rather analyzing the *interpretive functions* themselves. The novel becomes a study of the interplay between Shade's poem (the projection), and Kinbote's commentary (the attempted unprojection), resulting in a complex interplay of shadows and reflections.  Kinbote's interpretation serves as a "pale, lunar luminescence," illuminating the poem's shadow and transforming it into something new.\n\n\n**Gradus: A Character of Contradictions:**\n\nGradus embodies the novel's central themes. Kinbote relentlessly mocks him, reducing him to a mere reflection of Charles's fantastical journey devoid of humanity. Yet, Gradus's role is far more complex and requires further investigation within the framework of projection and unprojection presented here.  The presentation will continue to explore this character in greater depth, analyzing his contradictory nature within the context of Nabokov's unique literary technology.\nGradus: Complement, Not Mockery, in Pale Fire\n\nThis section argues that Gradus is not simply a mocking retelling of Charles's story, but rather its crucial complement.  While Charles's journey—from the palace to the port, through Paris and Switzerland, a visit to Villa Disa, and finally America—is detailed in the Index (page 306),  the specifics of this journey, except for its beginning and end, and the brief Villa Disa episode, are revealed only through Gradus's perspective.\n\n**The Dreamlike Nature of Villa Disa:**\n\nEvidence suggests Charles's visit to Villa Disa is largely a dream.  On page 206, Charles's arrival is described as a sudden appearance amidst garlands of shade.  Pages 210-213 detail his dreams of the villa's inhabitant, characterized by tender affection, awareness of her unrequited love, and a haunting confession (perhaps of homosexuality). The offer of lodging for "forty Arabian thieves" (page 213) fulfills the dreamlike requirements.  His dreams conclude on page 211, with a glimpsed smile that vanishes upon closer inspection.  The sequence ends on page 214 with a vision of a white figure, later revealed to be Fleur, not the villa's inhabitant. This reveals the dreamlike nature of the whole encounter.\n\n**Gradus as the Architect of Charles's Journey:**\n\nIt's Kinbote's narration of Gradus that constructs Charles's journey from Zembla to America, excluding the actual events in those locations.  Page 177 (in a parenthetical Gradus section) notes Charles reclining on a Parisian sofa, the same sofa Gradus occupies.  Page 200 reveals "The King was here," scrawled in charcoal at the lavender villa that Gradus both defiles and potentially creates. Thus, without Gradus, is there a Zemblan King Charles?  Does Odon's escape depend on Nodo's card-shuffling (page 150), which sets Gradus in pursuit of the king?\n\nGradus functions as structural support for Kinbote's fantasy, not just in form and language (his movement through caesuras and rhymes), but also in the narrative itself.  He allows Kinbote—and us—to see and create the journey.\n\n**Gradus and Aesthetic Consummation:**\n\nThis process-based view of Gradus aligns with Bakhtin's concept of heroic creation through the bestowal of death (as interpreted by Naiman in his chapter on Hermophobia).  Bakhtin states that "memory begins to act as a gathering and completing force from the very first moment of the hero's appearance; the hero is born in this memory (of his death)... in this sense we could say that death is the form of the aesthetic consummation of an individual" (Naiman 116).  Shade's preterist tendencies—recognizing death in every moment—culminate in this aesthetic consummation when *Pale Fire* is released from its earthly confines and enters Kinbote's grasp through Shade's murder by Gradus.\n\nGradus is both the facilitator of this consummation (carrying the poem's prosaic interpretation and enabling its apotheosis) and a frustrating, common mechanism that can only enable, never participate.  On page 154, Gradus guides the carving but never partakes.\n\n**Gradus's Multiplicity:**\n\nThis polyvalent role requires Gradus to exist not only as Gradus, but also as d'Argus, Jacques de Grey, and Jack Grey—specific narrative instances of the endless Gradus.  Jack Grey's tragic end (page 299) is a gesture of despair, not a clockwork malfunction.  However, even Jack's death does not end the function of Gradus (page 301). Regardless of Kinbote's fate or future interpretations, a "bigger, more respectable, and more competent Gradus" awaits.	2024-12-15 20:23:20.141475	2024-12-15 20:23:20.141477	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-pale fire presentation-8795", "chunks_count": 2}

Every day at eight in the morning he was\nbrought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but\ntoday she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked\nfrom his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an\ninquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the\nbell. There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered. He had never seen\nthe man in this house before. He was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and\nclose-fitting, with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of which\ngave the impression of being very practical but without making it very clear what they\nwere actually for. "Who are you?" asked K., sitting half upright in his bed. The man,\nhowever, ignored the question as if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely\nreplied, "You rang?" "Anna should have brought me my breakfast," said K. He tried to\nwork out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through observation and by\nthinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to be looked at for very long. Instead he\nwent over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing\nimmediately behind it, "He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast." There was a little\nlaughter in the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the sound of it whether there\nwere several people laughing. The strange man could not have learned anything from it\nthat he hadn't known already, but now he said to K., as if making his report "It is not\npossible." "It would be the first time that's happened," said K., as he jumped out of bed\nand quickly pulled on his trousers. "I want to see who that is in the next room, and why\nit is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this way." It immediately occurred to\nhim that he needn't have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have\nacknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the\ntime. That, at least, is how the stranger took it, as he said, "Don't you think you'd better\nstay where you are?" "I want neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've\nintroduced yourself." "I meant it for your own good," said the stranger and opened the\ndoor, this time without being asked. The next room, which K. entered more slowly than\nhe had intended, looked at first glance exactly the same as it had the previous evening. It\nwas Mrs. Grubach's living room, over-filled with furniture, tablecloths, porcelain and\nphotographs. Perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual today, but if so it\nwas not immediately obvious, especially as the main difference was the presence of a\nman sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up. "You should\nhave stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?" "And what is it you want, then?" said\nK., looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named Franz, who\nhad remained in the doorway. Through the open window he noticed the old woman\nagain, who had come close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see everything. She was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was\ngoing senile. "I want to see Mrs. Grubach ... ," said K., making a movement as if tearing\nhimself away from the two men - even though they were standing well away from him\nand wanted to go. "No," said the man at the window, who threw his book down on a\ncoffee table and stood up. "You can't go away when you're under arrest." "That's how it\nseems," said K. "And why am I under arrest?" he then asked. "That's something we're\nnot allowed to tell you. Go into your room and wait there. Proceedings are underway\nand you'll learn about everything all in good time. It's not really part of my job to be\nfriendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and\nhe's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself.\nIf you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers\nthen you can reckon on things going well with you." K. wanted to sit down, but then he\nsaw that, apart from the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room\nwhere he could sit. "You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is," said\nFranz and both men then walked up to K. They were significantly bigger than him,\nespecially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder. The two of them\nfelt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower\nquality, but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and\nreturn them to him if his case turned out well. "It's better for you if you give us the things\nthan if you leave them in the storeroom," they said. "Things have a tendency to go\nmissing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether\nthe case involved has come to an end or not. And cases like this can last a long time,\nespecially the ones that have been coming up lately. They'd give you the money they got\nfor them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're offered for them when they\nsell them that counts, it's how much they get slipped on the side, and things like that lose\ntheir value anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year." K. paid\nhardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he\nmay have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them. It was much more\nimportant to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think\nclearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only\nbe policemen - looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up\nand saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body. His strong nose twisted\nto one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an understanding with the other policeman.\nWhat sort of people were these? What were they talking about? What office did they\nbelong to? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws\nwere decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own home? He\nwas always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to cross bridges when he came to\nthem, pay no heed for the future, even when everything seemed under threat. But here\nthat did not seem the right thing to do. He could have taken it all as a joke, a big joke set\nup by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or also perhaps because today\nwas his thirtieth birthday, it was all possible of course, maybe all he had to do was laugh\nin the policemen's face in some way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were\ntradesmen from the corner of the street, they looked like they might be - but he was\nnonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight of the one called Franz, not to\nlose any slight advantage he might have had over these people. There was a very slight\nrisk that people would later say he couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in the habit of learning from experience - he might also have had a few\nunimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he had acted with\nno thought at all for what might follow and had been made to suffer for it. He didn't want\nthat to happen again, not this time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along\nwith them.\nHe still had time. "Allow me," he said, and hurried between the two policemen\nthrough into his room. "He seems sensible enough," he heard them say behind him.\nOnce in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it\nwas very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he\nwas looking for straight away. He finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go\nback to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty, so he carried on searching\nuntil he found his birth certificate. Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on\nthe other side opened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter. He only saw her for an\ninstant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed, asked for\nforgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very carefully. "Do come in,"\nK. could have said just then. But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers\nin his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again. He stayed like that\nuntil he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at\nthe open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast. "Why didn't she come\nin?" he asked. "She's not allowed to," said the big policeman. "You're under arrest,\naren't you." "But how can I be under arrest? And how come it's like this?" "Now you're\nstarting again," said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot.\n"We don't answer questions like that." "You will have to answer them," said K. "Here\nare my identification papers, now show me yours and I certainly want to see the arrest\nwarrant." "Oh, my God!" said the policeman. "In a position like yours, and you think\nyou can start giving orders, do you? It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong\nside, even if you think it will - we're probably more on your side that anyone else you\nknow!" "That's true, you know, you'd better believe it," said Franz, holding a cup of\ncoffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was\nprobably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood. K. found\nhimself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand\ndown on his papers and said, "Here are my identity documents." "And what do you want\nus to do about it?" replied the big policeman, loudly. "The way you're carrying on, it's\nworse than a child. What is it you want? Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of\nyours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just\ncoppers, that's all we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card from\nanother, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get\npaid for it. That's all we are. Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high\nofficials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and\nwhy he should be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There's no mistake there. Our\nauthorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for\nguilt among the public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they\nhave to send us police officers out. That's the law. Where d'you think there'd be any\nmistake there?" "I don't know this law," said K. "So much the worse for you, then," said\nthe policeman. "It's probably exists only in your heads," said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts\nto his benefit or to make himself at home there. But the policeman just said dismissively,\n"You'll find out when it affects you." Franz joined in, and said, "Look at this, Willem, he\nadmits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent." "You're quite\nright, but we can't get him to understand a thing," said the other. K. stopped talking with\nthem; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up with the\nchattering of base functionaries like this? - and they admit themselves that they are of the\nlowest position. They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest\nunderstanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure\nof themselves. I just need few words with someone of the same social standing as\nmyself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long\nconversation with these two can make it. He walked up and down the free space in the\nroom a couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who, now, had\npulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window and had her arms around\nhim. K. had to put an end to this display, "Take me to your superior," he said. "As soon\nas he wants to see you. Not before," said the policeman, the one called Willem. "And\nnow my advice to you," he added, "is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait and see\nwhat's to be done with you. If you take our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking\nabout things to no purpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's going\nto required of you. You've not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so\ngood to you, you forget that we, whatever we are, we're still free men and you're not, and\nthat's quite an advantage. But in spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the\nmoney, to go and get you some breakfast from the café over the road."\nWithout giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some time. Perhaps, if\nhe opened the door of the next room or even the front door, the two of them would not\ndare to stand in his way, perhaps that would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing,\nby bringing it to a head. But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on\nthe ground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them. So he\ndecided on the more certain solution, the way things would go in the natural course of\nevents, and went back in his room without another word either from him or from the\npolicemen.\nHe threw himself down on his bed, and from the dressing table he took the nice\napple that he had put there the previous evening for his breakfast. Now it was all the\nbreakfast he had and anyway, as he confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it\nwas far better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the policemen\nfrom the dirty café. He felt well and confident, he had failed to go into work at the bank\nthis morning but that could easily be excused because of the relatively high position he\nheld there. Should he really send in his explanation? He wondered about it. If nobody\nbelieved him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs. Grubach\nin as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street, who probably even now were\non their way over to the window opposite. It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking\nat it from the policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left\nhim alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself. At the same time,\nthough, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so. Because those two were sitting there in the next room and had\ntaken his breakfast, perhaps? It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if\nhe had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable. Maybe, if the\npolicemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental abilities, it could have been\nsupposed that they had come to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him\nalone because of it. They could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to\nthe cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he first emptied a\nglass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then took a second glassful in order to\ngive himself courage, the last one just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be\nneeded.\nThen he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his\nteeth against the glass. "The supervisor wants to see you!" a voice said. It was only the\nshout that startled him, this curt, abrupt, military shout, that he would not have expected\nfrom the policeman called Franz. In itself, he found the order very welcome. "At last!"\nhe called back, locked the cupboard and, without delay, hurried into the next room. The\ntwo policemen were standing there and chased him back into his bedroom as if that were\na matter of course. "What d'you think you're doing?" they cried. "Think you're going to\nsee the supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you? He'd see to it you got a right\nthumping, and us and all!" "Let go of me for God's sake!" called K., who had already\nbeen pushed back as far as his wardrobe, "if you accost me when I'm still in bed you can't\nexpect to find me in my evening dress." "That won't help you," said the policemen, who\nalways became very quiet, almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way confused\nhim or, to some extent, brought him to his senses. "Ridiculous formalities!" he grumbled,\nas he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while, as if\nholding it out for the policemen's inspection. They shook their heads. "It's got to be a\nblack coat," they said. At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and said - without knowing\neven himself what he meant by it - "Well it's not going to be the main trial, after all."\nThe policemen laughed, but continued to insist, "It's got to be a black coat." "Well that's\nalright by me if it makes things go any faster," said K. He opened the wardrobe himself,\nspent a long time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black suit which\nhad a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out\na fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get dressed. He secretly told himself that he had\nsucceeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath.\nHe watched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it never occurred\nto them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the\nmessage saying that K. was getting dressed.\nOnce he was properly dressed, K. had to pass by Willem as he went through the\nnext room into the one beyond, the door of which was already wide open. K. knew very\nwell that this room had recently been let to a typist called 'Miss Bürstner'. She was in the\nhabit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never\nexchanged more than a few words of greeting with her. Now, her bedside table had been\npulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings, and the\nsupervisor sat behind it. He had his legs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the\nbackrest of the chair. In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the\nphotographs belonging to Miss Bürstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the\nwall. Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white blouse. At the window\nacross the street, there was the old pair again, although now their number had increased,\nas behind them, and far taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed\nhis chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers.\n"Josef K.?" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to attract K.'s attention as he looked\nround the room. K. nodded. "I daresay you were quite surprised by all that's been taking\nplace this morning," said the supervisor as, with both hands, he pushed away the few\nitems on the bedside table - the candle and box of matches, a book and a pin cushion\nwhich lay there as if they were things he would need for his own business. "Certainly,"\nsaid K., and he began to feel relaxed now that, at last, he stood in front of someone with\nsome sense, someone with whom he would be able to talk about his situation. "Certainly\nI'm surprised, but I'm not in any way very surprised." "You're not very surprised?" asked\nthe supervisor, as he positioned the candle in the middle of the table and the other things\nin a group around it. "Perhaps you don't quite understand me," K. hurriedly pointed out.\n"What I mean is\n" here K. broke off what he was saying and looked round for\nsomewhere to sit. "I may sit down, mayn't I?" he asked. "That's not usual," the\nsupervisor answered. "What I mean is...," said K. without delaying a second time, "that,\nyes, I am very surprised but when you've been in the world for thirty years already and\nhad to make your own way through everything yourself, which has been my lot, then you\nbecome hardened to surprises and don't take them too hard. Especially not what's\nhappened today." "Why especially not what's happened today?" "I wouldn't want to say\nthat I see all of this as a joke, you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these\narrangements for that. Everyone in the house must be taking part in it as well as all of\nyou, that would be going beyond what could be a joke. So I don't want to say that this is\na joke." "Quite right," said the supervisor, looking to see how many matches were left in\nthe box. "But on the other hand," K. went on, looking round at everyone there and even\nwishing he could get the attention of the three who were looking at the photographs, "on\nthe other hand this really can't be all that important. That follows from the fact that I've\nbeen indicted, but can't think of the slightest offence for which I could be indicted. But\neven that is all beside the point, the main question is: Who is issuing the indictment?\nWhat office is conducting this affair? Are you officials? None of you is wearing a\nuniform, unless what you are wearing" - here he turned towards Franz - "is meant to be a\nuniform, it's actually more of a travelling suit. I require a clear answer to all these\nquestions, and I'm quite sure that once things have been made clear we can take our leave\nof each other on the best of terms." The supervisor slammed the box of matches down\non the table. "You're making a big mistake," he said. "These gentlemen and I have got\nnothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you. We could\nbe wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like and your situation wouldn't be any\nthe worse for it. As to whether you're on a charge, I can't give you any sort of clear\nanswer to that, I don't even know whether you are or not. You're under arrest, you're\nquite right about that, but I don't know any more than that. Maybe these officers have\nbeen chit-chatting with you, well if they have that's all it is, chit-chat. I can't give you an\nanswer to your questions, but I can give you a bit of advice: You'd better think less about us and what's going to happen to you, and think a bit more about yourself. And stop\nmaking all this fuss about your sense of innocence; you don't make such a bad\nimpression, but with all this fuss you're damaging it. And you ought to do a bit less\ntalking, too. Almost everything you've said so far has been things we could have taken\nfrom your behaviour, even if you'd said no more than a few words. And what you have\nsaid has not exactly been in your favour."\nK. stared at the supervisor. Was this man, probably younger than he was,\nlecturing him like a schoolmaster? Was he being punished for his honesty with a telling\noff? And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were\narresting him? He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down. No-one\nstopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his\nhair, went over to the three men, said, "It makes no sense," at which these three turned\nround to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again\nto a halt in front of the supervisor's desk. "State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of\nmine," he said, "can I telephone him?" "Certainly," said the supervisor, "but I don't know\nwhat the point of that will be, I suppose you must have some private matter you want to\ndiscuss with him." "What the point is?" shouted K., more disconcerted that cross. "Who\ndo you think you are? You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out\nsomething as pointless as it could be? It's enough to make you cry! These gentlemen\nfirst accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of\nyou. What point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm ostensibly\nunder arrest? Very well, I won't make the telephone call." "You can call him if you want\nto," said the supervisor, stretching his had out towards the outer room where the\ntelephone was, "please, go on, do make your phone call." "No, I don't want to any more,"\nsaid K., and went over to the window. Across the street, the people were still there at the\nwindow, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to\nbecome uneasy about quietly watching what was going on. The old couple wanted to get\nup but the man behind them calmed them down. "We've got some kind of audience over\nthere," called K. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger.\n"Go away," he then called across to them. And the three of them did immediately retreat\na few steps, the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them\nwith the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be\nsaying something incomprehensible into the distance. They did not disappear entirely,\nthough, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come back to the\nwindow without being noticed. "Intrusive, thoughtless people!" said K. as he turned back\ninto the room. The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was\nwhat he saw from the corner of his eye. But it was just as possible that he had not even\nbeen listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed to be\ncomparing the length of his fingers. The two policemen were sitting on a chest covered\nwith a coloured blanket, rubbing their knees. The three young people had put their hands\non their hips and were looking round aimlessly. Everything was still, like in some office\nthat has been forgotten about. "Now, gentlemen," called out K., and for a moment it\nseemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, "it looks like your business\nwith me is over with. In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about whether\nyou're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake. If you are of the same opinion, then please... " and he walked up to\nthe supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him. The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his\nlip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the supervisor would do as he\nsuggested. But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss\nBürstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new\nhat. "Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it," he said to K. as he did so, "so you\nthink we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do you. No, no, that won't do.\nMind you, on the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for\nyou. No, why should you think that? You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that.\nThat's what I had to tell you, that's what I've done and now I've seen how you've taken it.\nThat's enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at\nleast. I expect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you." "In to the bank?" asked\nK., "I thought I was under arrest." K. said this with a certain amount of defiance as,\nalthough his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more independent of all\nthese people, especially since the supervisor had stood up. He was playing with them. If\nthey left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let them arrest him. That's\nwhy he even repeated, "How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?" "I see\nyou've misunderstood me," said the supervisor who was already at the door. "It's true that\nyou're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job. And there\nshouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual life." "In that case it's not\ntoo bad, being under arrest," said K., and went up close to the supervisor. "I never meant\nit should be anything else," he replied. "It hardly seems to have been necessary notify me\nof the arrest in that case," said K., and went even closer. The others had also come\ncloser. All of them had gathered together into a narrow space by the door. "That was my\nduty," said the supervisor. "A silly duty," said K., unyielding. "Maybe so," replied the\nsupervisor, "only don't let's waste our time talking on like this. I had assumed you'd be\nwanting to go to the bank. As you're paying close attention to every word I'll add this:\nI'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to. And to make\nthings easier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put\nthese three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal." "What's that?" exclaimed\nK., and looked at the three in astonishment. He could only remember seeing them in\ntheir group by the photographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were\nindeed officials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it\nshowed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior\nmembers of staff at the bank. How could K. have failed to see that? How occupied he\nmust have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to have recognised these three!\nRabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair\nand deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle\nspasms. "Good morning," said K. after a while, extending his hand to the gentlemen as\nthey bowed correctly to him. "I didn't recognise you at all. So, we'll go into work now,\nshall we?" The gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they\nhad been waiting for all the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all\ndashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a certain amount of\nembarrassment. K. stood where he was and watched them through the open double\ndoorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no\nmore than an elegant trot. Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the	2025-01-03 21:52:06.841679	2025-01-03 21:52:06.841682	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-The Trial - Franz Kafka-9887", "chunks_count": 13}

Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness. In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of it. In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination, and volition.[2] Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling, or perception. It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, metacognition, or self-awareness, either continuously changing or not.[3][4] The disparate range of research, notions, and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked.[5]\n\nExamples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: ordered distinction between self and environment, simple wakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by "looking within"; being a metaphorical "stream" of contents, or being a mental state, mental event, or mental process of the brain.\n\nEtymology [ edit ]\n\nThe words "conscious" and "consciousness" in the English language date to the 17th century, and the first recorded use of "conscious" as a simple adjective was applied figuratively to inanimate objects ("the conscious Groves", 1643).[6]: 175 It derived from the Latin conscius (con- "together" and scio "to know") which meant "knowing with" or "having joint or common knowledge with another", especially as in sharing a secret.[7] Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan (1651) wrote: "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another".[8] There were also many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as "knowing with oneself", or in other words "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". This phrase has the figurative sense of "knowing that one knows", which is something like the modern English word "conscious", but it was rendered into English as "conscious to oneself" or "conscious unto oneself". For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness".[9]\n\nThe Latin conscientia, literally 'knowledge-with', first appears in Roman juridical texts by writers such as Cicero. It means a kind of shared knowledge with moral value, specifically what a witness knows of someone else's deeds.[10][11] Although René Descartes (1596–1650), writing in Latin, is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way less like the traditional meaning and more like the way modern English speakers would use "conscience", his meaning is nowhere defined.[12] In Search after Truth (Regulæ ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale, Amsterdam 1701) he wrote the word with a gloss: conscientiâ, vel interno testimonio (translatable as "conscience, or internal testimony").[13][14] It might mean the knowledge of the value of one's own thoughts.[12]\n\nThe origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to John Locke who defined the word in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1690, as "the perception of what passes in a man's own mind".[15][16] The essay strongly influenced 18th-century British philosophy, and Locke's definition appeared in Samuel Johnson's celebrated Dictionary (1755).[17]\n\nThe French term conscience is defined roughly like English "consciousness" in the 1753 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie as "the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do".[18]\n\nProblem of definition [ edit ]\n\nAbout forty meanings attributed to the term consciousness can be identified and categorized based on functions and experiences. The prospects for reaching any single, agreed-upon, theory-independent definition of consciousness appear remote.[19]\n\nScholars are divided as to whether Aristotle had a concept of consciousness. He does not use any single word or terminology that is clearly similar to the phenomenon or concept defined by John Locke. Victor Caston contends that Aristotle did have a concept more clearly similar to perception.[20]\n\nModern dictionary definitions of the word consciousness evolved over several centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings, with some differences that have been controversial, such as the distinction between inward awareness and perception of the physical world, or the distinction between conscious and unconscious, or the notion of a mental entity or mental activity that is not physical.\n\nThe common-usage definitions of consciousness in Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1966) are as follows:\n\nawareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact; intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self\n\ninward awareness of an external object, state, or fact\n\nconcerned awareness; INTEREST, CONCERN—often used with an attributive noun [e.g. class consciousness] the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought; mind in the broadest possible sense; something in nature that is distinguished from the physical the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span—compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS waking life (as that to which one returns after sleep, trance, fever) wherein all one's mental powers have returned . . . the part of mental life or psychic content in psychoanalysis that is immediately available to the ego—compare PRECONSCIOUS, UNCONSCIOUS\n\nThe Cambridge English Dictionary defines consciousness as "the state of understanding and realizing something".[21] The Oxford Living Dictionary defines consciousness as "[t]he state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings", "[a] person's awareness or perception of something", and "[t]he fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world".[22]\n\nPhilosophers have attempted to clarify technical distinctions by using a jargon of their own. The corresponding entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998) reads:\n\nConsciousness Philosophers have used the term consciousness for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial. [ 23 ]\n\nTraditional metaphors for mind [ edit ]\n\nDuring the early 19th century, the emerging field of geology inspired a popular metaphor that the mind likewise had hidden layers "which recorded the past of the individual".[24]: 3 By 1875, most psychologists believed that "consciousness was but a small part of mental life",[24]: 3 and this idea underlies the goal of Freudian therapy, to expose the unconscious layer of the mind.\n\nOther metaphors from various sciences inspired other analyses of the mind, for example: Johann Friedrich Herbart described ideas as being attracted and repulsed like magnets; John Stuart Mill developed the idea of "mental chemistry" and "mental compounds", and Edward B. Titchener sought the "structure" of the mind by analyzing its "elements". The abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states of matter.\n\nIn 1892, William James noted that the "ambiguous word 'content' has been recently invented instead of 'object'" and that the metaphor of mind as a container seemed to minimize the dualistic problem of how "states of consciousness can know" things, or objects;[25]: 465 by 1899 psychologists were busily studying the "contents of conscious experience by introspection and experiment".[26]: 365 Another popular metaphor was James's doctrine of the stream of consciousness, with continuity, fringes, and transitions.[25]: vii [a]\n\nJames discussed the difficulties of describing and studying psychological phenomena, recognizing that commonly-used terminology was a necessary and acceptable starting point towards more precise, scientifically justified language. Prime examples were phrases like inner experience and personal consciousness:\n\nThe first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experience is the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on. 'States of mind' succeed each other in him. [...] But everyone knows what the terms mean [only] in a rough way; [...] When I say every 'state' or 'thought' is part of a personal consciousness, 'personal consciousness' is one of the terms in question. Its meaning we know so long as no one asks us to define it, but to give an accurate account of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks. [...] The only states of consciousness that we naturally deal with are found in personal consciousnesses, minds, selves, concrete particular I's and you's. [25]: 152–153\n\nFrom introspection to awareness [ edit ]\n\nPrior to the 20th century, philosophers treated the phenomenon of consciousness as the "inner world [of] one's own mind", and introspection was the mind "attending to" itself,[b] an activity seemingly distinct from that of perceiving the 'outer world' and its physical phenomena. In 1892 William James noted the distinction along with doubts about the inward character of the mind:\n\n'Things' have been doubted, but thoughts and feelings have never been doubted. The outer world, but never the inner world, has been denied. Everyone assumes that we have direct introspective acquaintance with our thinking activity as such, with our consciousness as something inward and contrasted with the outer objects which it knows. Yet I must confess that for my part I cannot feel sure of this conclusion. [...] It seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a postulate than a sensibly given fact...[25]: 467\n\nBy the 1960s, for many philosophers and psychologists who talked about consciousness, the word no longer meant the 'inner world' but an indefinite, large category called awareness, as in the following example:\n\nIt is difficult for modern Western man to grasp that the Greeks really had no concept of consciousness in that they did not class together phenomena as varied as problem solving, remembering, imagining, perceiving, feeling pain, dreaming, and acting on the grounds that all these are manifestations of being aware or being conscious.[28]: 4\n\nMany philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.[29] In The Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology (1989 edition), Stuart Sutherland emphasized external awareness, and expressed a skeptical attitude more than a definition:\n\nConsciousness—The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means. Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness—to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.[29]\n\nUsing 'awareness', however, as a definition or synonym of consciousness is not a simple matter:\n\nIf awareness of the environment . . . is the criterion of consciousness, then even the protozoans are conscious. If awareness of awareness is required, then it is doubtful whether the great apes and human infants are conscious.[26]\n\nInfluence on research [ edit ]\n\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood by the majority of people despite the difficulty philosophers have had defining it.[30] Max Velmans proposed that the "everyday understanding of consciousness" uncontroversially "refers to experience itself rather than any particular thing that we observe or experience" and he added that consciousness "is [therefore] exemplified by all the things that we observe or experience",[31]: 4 whether thoughts, feelings, or perceptions. Velmans noted however, as of 2009, that there was a deep level of "confusion and internal division"[31] among experts about the phenomenon of consciousness, because researchers lacked "a sufficiently well-specified use of the term...to agree that they are investigating the same thing".[31]: 3 He argued additionally that "pre-existing theoretical commitments" to competing explanations of consciousness might be a source of bias.\n\nWithin the "modern consciousness studies" community the technical phrase 'phenomenal consciousness' is a common synonym for all forms of awareness, or simply 'experience',[31]: 4 without differentiating between inner and outer, or between higher and lower types. With advances in brain research, "the presence or absence of experienced phenomena"[31]: 3 of any kind underlies the work of those neuroscientists who seek "to analyze the precise relation of conscious phenomenology to its associated information processing" in the brain.[31]: 10 This neuroscientific goal is to find the "neural correlates of consciousness" (NCC). One criticism of this goal is that it begins with a theoretical commitment to the neurological origin of all "experienced phenomena" whether inner or outer.[c] Also, the fact that the easiest 'content of consciousness' to be so analyzed is "the experienced three-dimensional world (the phenomenal world) beyond the body surface"[31]: 4 invites another criticism, that most consciousness research since the 1990s, perhaps because of bias, has focused on processes of external perception.[33]\n\nFrom a history of psychology perspective, Julian Jaynes rejected popular but "superficial views of consciousness"[2]: 447 especially those which equate it with "that vaguest of terms, experience".[24]: 8 In 1976 he insisted that if not for introspection, which for decades had been ignored or taken for granted rather than explained, there could be no "conception of what consciousness is"[24]: 18 and in 1990, he reaffirmed the traditional idea of the phenomenon called 'consciousness', writing that "its denotative definition is, as it was for René Descartes, John Locke, and David Hume, what is introspectable".[2]: 450 Jaynes saw consciousness as an important but small part of human mentality, and he asserted: "there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until ... what is introspectable [is] sharply distinguished"[2]: 447 from the unconscious processes of cognition such as perception, reactive awareness and attention, and automatic forms of learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.[24]: 21-47\n\nThe cognitive science point of view—with an inter-disciplinary perspective involving fields such as psychology, linguistics and anthropology[34]—requires no agreed definition of "consciousness" but studies the interaction of many processes besides perception. For some researchers, consciousness is linked to some kind of "selfhood", for example to certain pragmatic issues such as the feeling of agency and the effects of regret[33] and action on experience of one's own body or social identity.[35] Similarly Daniel Kahneman, who focused on systematic errors in perception, memory and decision-making, has differentiated between two kinds of mental processes, or cognitive "systems":[36] the "fast" activities that are primary, automatic and "cannot be turned off",[36]: 22 and the "slow", deliberate, effortful activities of a secondary system "often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration".[36]: 13 Kahneman's two systems have been described as "roughly corresponding to unconscious and conscious processes".[37]: 8 The two systems can interact, for example in sharing the control of attention.[36]: 22 While System 1 can be impulsive, "System 2 is in charge of self-control",[36]: 26 and "When we think of ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do".[36]: 21\n\nSome have argued that we should eliminate the concept from our understanding of the mind, a position known as consciousness semanticism.[38]\n\nIn medicine, a "level of consciousness" terminology is used to describe a patient's arousal and responsiveness, which can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli.[39] Issues of practical concern include how the level of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted.[40] The degree or level of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior observation scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy of mind [ edit ]\n\nWhile historically philosophers have defended various views on consciousness, surveys indicate that physicalism is now the dominant position among contemporary philosophers of mind.[41] For an overview of the field, approaches often include both historical perspectives (e.g., Descartes, Locke, Kant) and organization by key issues in contemporary debates. An alternative is to focus primarily on current philosophical stances and empirical findings.\n\nCoherence of the concept [ edit ]\n\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.[42] While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,[30] skeptics argue that this intuition is too narrow, either because the concept of consciousness is embedded in our intuitions, or because we all are illusions. Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of entities, or identities, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of "consciousness" we end up leading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.[43]\n\nTypes [ edit ]\n\nNed Block argued that discussions on consciousness often failed to properly distinguish phenomenal (P-consciousness) from access (A-consciousness), though these terms had been used before Block.[44] P-consciousness, according to Block, is raw experience: it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the past is access conscious, and so on. Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction,[45] others have broadly accepted it. David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.[46]\n\nSome philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story. William Lycan, for example, argued in his book Consciousness and Experience that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness of; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)—and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.[47]\n\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately. Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block, for instance, suggests the case of a "zombie" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding "I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility".[48]\n\nDistinguishing consciousness from its contents [ edit ]\n\nSam Harris observes: "At the level of your experience, you are not a body of cells, organelles, and atoms; you are consciousness and its ever-changing contents".[49] Seen in this way, consciousness is a subjectively experienced, ever-present field in which things (the contents of consciousness) come and go.\n\nChristopher Tricker argues that this field of consciousness is symbolized by the mythical bird that opens the Daoist classic the Zhuangzi. This bird's name is Of a Flock (peng 鵬), yet its back is countless thousands of miles across and its wings are like clouds arcing across the heavens. "Like Of a Flock, whose wings arc across the heavens, the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon. At the same time, the wings of every other being's consciousness span to the horizon. You are of a flock, one bird among kin."[50]\n\nMind–body problem [ edit ]\n\nIllustration of mind–body dualism by René Descartes. Inputs are passed by the sensory organs to the pineal gland, and from there to the immaterial spirit.\n\nMental processes (such as consciousness) and physical processes (such as brain events) seem to be correlated, however the specific nature of the connection is unknown.\n\nThe first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was Descartes, and the answer he gave is known as mind–body dualism. Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things, which he called res extensa (the realm of extension).[51] He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland.[52]\n\nAlthough it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed.[53] However, no alternative solution has gained general acceptance. Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories: dualist solutions that maintain Descartes's rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and monist solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects. Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants. The two main types of dualism are substance dualism (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics), and property dualism (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind). The three main types of monism are physicalism (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), idealism (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and neutral monism (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them). There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.[54]\n\nSince the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms. The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie, in his book Man a Machine (L'homme machine). His arguments, however, were very abstract.[55] The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman[56] and Antonio Damasio,[57] and by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett,[58] seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as Christof Koch,[59] have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness.[60]\n\nA few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness.[61] Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel[62] could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.[63] Empirical evidence is against the notion of quantum consciousness, an experiment about wave function collapse led by Catalina Curceanu in 2022 suggests that quantum consciousness, as suggested by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, is highly implausible.[64]\n\nApart from the general question of the "hard problem" of consciousness (which is, roughly speaking, the question of how mental experience can arise from a physical basis[65]), a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least in some small measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.\n\nProblem of other minds [ edit ]\n\nMany philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological question: Given that I can only observe the behavior of others, how can I know that others have minds?[66] The problem of other minds is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.[67] Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois,[68] and by Colin Allen (a professor at the University of Pittsburgh) regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.[69]\n\nThe most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences of the sort that we do.[70] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe.[70] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in a research paper titled "The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies", argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying.[71] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.[72]\n\nQualia [ edit ]\n\nThe term "qualia" was introduced in philosophical literature by C. I. Lewis. The word is derived from Latin and means "of what sort". It is basically a quantity or property of something as perceived or experienced by an individual, like the scent of rose, the taste of wine, or the pain of a headache. They are difficult to articulate or describe. The philosopher and scientist Daniel Dennett describes them as "the way things seem to us", while philosopher and cognitive scientist David Chalmers expanded on qualia as the "hard problem of consciousness" in the 1990s. When qualia is experienced, activity is simulated in the brain, and these processes are called neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). Many scientific studies have been done to attempt to link particular brain regions with emotions or experiences.[73][74][75]\n\nSpecies which experience qualia are said to have sentience, which is central to the animal rights movement, because it includes the ability to experience pain and suffering.[73]\n\nScientific study [ edit ]\n\nFor many decades, consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists, because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods.[76] In 1975 George Mandler published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow, serial, and limited conscious processes and fast, parallel and extensive unconscious ones.[77] The Science and Religion Forum[78] 1984 annual conference, 'From Artificial Intelligence to Human Consciousness' identified the nature of consciousness as a matter for investigation; Donald Michie was a keynote speaker. Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called Consciousness Studies, giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books,[79] journals such as Consciousness and Cognition, Frontiers in Consciousness Research, Psyche, and the Journal of Consciousness Studies, along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness[80] and the Society for Consciousness Studies.\n\nModern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli),[81] and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs. Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts. The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired. In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.[59]\n\nMeasurement via verbal report [ edit ]\n\nThe Necker cube, an ambiguous image\n\nExperimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties, due to the lack of a universally accepted operational definition. In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report: in other words, subjects are asked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness.[82]\n\nFor example, subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it "flipping" between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same.[83] The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of response priming, the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).[84]\n\nVerbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues.[85] For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult to make sense of the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected.[86] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted.[87] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.[88]\n\nAlthough verbal report is in practice the "gold standard" for ascribing consciousness, it is not the only possible criterion.[85] In medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal, brain activity, and purposeful movement. The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent.[89][90] The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive. Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed, however, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness.[84] Studies related to the neuroscience of free will have also shown that the influence consciousness has on decision-making is not always straightforward.[91]\n\nMirror test and contingency awareness [ edit ]\n\nAnother approach applies specifically to the study of self-awareness, that is, the ability to distinguish oneself from others. In the 1970s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the mirror test. The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves.[92] Humans (older than 18 months) and other great apes, bottlenose dolphins, orcas, pigeons, European magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test.[93] While some other animals like pigs have been shown to find food by looking into the mirror.[94]\n\nContingency awareness is another such approach, which is basically the conscious understanding of one's actions and its effects on one's environment.[95] It is recognized as a factor in self-recognition. The brain processes during contingency awareness and learning is believed to rely on an intact medial temporal lobe and age. A study done in 2020 involving transcranial direct current stimulation, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eyeblink classical conditioning supported the idea that the parietal cortex serves as a substrate for contingency awareness and that age-related disruption of this region is sufficient to impair awareness.[96]\n\nNeural correlates [ edit ]\n\nSchema of the neural processes underlying consciousness, from Christof Koch\n\nA major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains—that is, studies of the neural correlates of consciousness. The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness. Several brain imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies.[97]\n\nAnother idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency (gamma band) oscillations in brain activity. This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s, by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer, that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called binding problem, by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience.[98] Rodolfo Llinás, for example, proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations.[99]\n\nA number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex (V1) show clear electrical responses to a stimulus.[100] Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions.[101] There is substantial evidence that a "top-down" flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a "bottom-up" flow of activity.[102] The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).[103] Furthermore, top-down feedback from higher to lower visual brain areas may be weaker or absent in the peripheral visual field, as suggested by some experimental data and theoretical arguments;[104] nevertheless humans can perceive visual inputs in the peripheral visual field arising from bottom-up V1 neural activities.[104][105] Meanwhile, bottom-up V1 activities for the central visual fields can be vetoed, and thus made invisible to perception, by the top-down feedback, when these bottom-up signals are inconsistent with the brain's internal model of the visual world.[104][105]\n\nModulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony.[106] An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas.[107] This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.\n\nIn 2013, the perturbational complexity index (PCI) was proposed, a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state,[108] making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.\n\nAssuming that not only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious—a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds—there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologs can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al.[109] is that some of the major theories for the mammalian brain[110][111][112] also appear to be valid for the avian brain. The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch,[110] Edelman and Tononi,[111] and Cotterill [112] seem to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity.[111] Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologs have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles[113][114] seems incompatible, since a structural homolog/analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains. The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.\n\nJoaquin Fuster of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans, along with the areas of Wernicke and Broca, as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuro-anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans.[115]\n\nA study in 2016 looked at lesions in specific areas of the brainstem that were associated with coma and vegetative states. A small region of the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum in the brainstem was suggested to drive consciousness through functional connectivity with two cortical regions, the left ventral anterior insular cortex, and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. These three regions may work together as a triad to maintain consciousness.[116]\n\nModels [ edit ]\n\nA wide range of empirical theories of consciousness have been proposed.[117][118][119] Adrian Doerig and colleagues list 13 notable theories,[119] while Anil Seth and Tim Bayne list 22 notable theories.[118]\n\nGlobal workspace theory [ edit ]\n\nGlobal workspace theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in 1988. Baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater, with conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage. This theater integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks (represented in the metaphor by a broad, unlit "audience"). The theory has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene and Lionel Naccache.[120][121]\n\nIntegrated information theory [ edit ]\n\nIntegrated information theory (IIT), pioneered by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi in 2004, postulates that consciousness resides in the information being processed and arises once the information reaches a certain level of complexity. Additionally, IIT is one of the only leading theories of consciousness that attempts to create a 1:1 mapping between conscious states and precise, formal mathematical descriptions of those mental states. Proponents of this model suggest that it may provide a physical grounding for consciousness in neurons, as they provide the mechanism by which information is integrated. This also relates to the "hard problem of consciousness" proposed by David Chalmers. The theory remains controversial, because of its lack of credibility.[clarification needed][122][123][73]\n\nOrchestrated objective reduction [ edit ]\n\nOrchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR), or the quantum theory of mind, was proposed by scientists Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, and states that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons. The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules, which form the cytoskeleton around which the brain is built. The duo proposed that these quantum processes accounted for creativity, innovation, and problem-solving abilities. Penrose published his views in the book The Emperor's New Mind. In 2014, the discovery of quantum vibrations inside microtubules gave new life to the argument.[73]\n\nAttention schema theory [ edit ]\n\nIn 2011, Graziano and Kastner[124] proposed the "attention schema" theory of awareness. In that theory, specific cortical areas, notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction, are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people. The same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself. Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect. In the attention schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing. Attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals. Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.\n\nEntropic brain theory [ edit ]\n\nThe entropic brain is a theory of conscious states informed by neuroimaging research with psychedelic drugs. The theory suggests that the brain in primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, early psychosis and under the influence of psychedelic drugs, is in a disordered state; normal waking consciousness constrains some of this freedom and makes possible metacognitive functions such as internal self-administered reality testing and self-awareness.[125][126][127][128] Criticism has included questioning whether the theory has been adequately tested.[129]\n\nProjective consciousness model [ edit ]\n\nIn 2017, work by David Rudrauf and colleagues, including Karl Friston, applied the active inference paradigm to consciousness, leading to the projective consciousness model (PCM), a model of how sensory data is integrated with priors in a process of projective transformation. The authors argue that, while their model identifies a key relationship between computation and phenomenology, it does not completely solve the hard problem of consciousness or completely close the explanatory gap.[130]\n\nClaustrum being the conductor for consciousness [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, a proposal was made by molecular biologist Francis Crick (co-discoverer of the double helix), which stated that to bind together an individual's experience, a conductor of an orchestra is required. Together with neuroscientist Christof Koch, he proposed that this conductor would have to collate information rapidly from various regions of the brain. The duo reckoned that the claustrum was well suited for the task. However, Crick died while working on the idea.[73]\n\nThe proposal is backed by a study done in 2014, where a team at the George Washington University induced unconsciousness in a 54-year-old woman suffering from intractable epilepsy by stimulating her claustrum. The woman underwent depth electrode implantation and electrical stimulation mapping. The electrode between the left claustrum and anterior-dorsal insula was the one which induced unconsciousness. Correlation for interactions affecting medial parietal and posterior frontal channels during stimulation increased significantly as well. Their findings suggested that the left claustrum or anterior insula is an important part of a network that subserves consciousness, and that disruption of consciousness is related to increased EEG signal synchrony within frontal-parietal networks. However, this remains an isolated, hence inconclusive study.[73][131]\n\nBiological function and evolution [ edit ]\n\nThe emergence of consciousness during biological evolution remains a topic of ongoing scientific inquiry. The survival value of consciousness is still a matter of exploration and understanding. While consciousness appears to play a crucial role in human cognition, decision-making, and self-awareness, its adaptive significance across different species remains a subject of debate.\n\nSome people question whether consciousness has any survival value. Some argue that consciousness is a by-product of evolution. Thomas Henry Huxley for example defends in an essay titled "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History" an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness, according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity—"as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".[132] To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious.[133][134] Karl Popper develops a similar evolutionary argument in the book The Self and Its Brain.[135]\n\nOpinions are divided on when and how consciousness first arose. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles.[136] Other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago.[137] Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness.[138] Further exploration of the origins of consciousness, particularly in molluscs, has been done by Peter Godfrey Smith in his book Metazoa.[139]\n\nRegarding the primary function of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be independent.[140] This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner.[141] Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyzes, etc.), and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.[142] Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of Ezequiel Morsella.[142]\n\nAs noted earlier, even among writers who consider consciousness to be well-defined, there is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it.[143] Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties. Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that increases fitness.[144] In his article "Evolution of consciousness", John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness ("[a] psychon ... linked to [a] dendron through quantum physics").[145] Bernard Baars proposed that once in place, this "recursive" circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms.[146] Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality.[147] This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them (e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage) and behave accordingly, and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends.\n\nOther philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.[148][149] No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a philosophical zombie) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function F being performed by conscious organism O and non-conscious organism O*, it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide.[150] As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement.[137] Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired.[151] Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness (see Neural correlates section above).\n\nAltered states [ edit ]\n\nA Buddhist monk meditating\n\nThere are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent, including dreamless sleep or coma. There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways, producing what are known as altered states of consciousness. Some altered states occur naturally; others can be produced by drugs or brain damage.[152] Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking, disturbances in the sense of time, feelings of loss of control, changes in emotional expression, alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance.[153]\n\nThe two most widely accepted altered states are sleep and dreaming. Although dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer, each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity, metabolic activity, and eye movement; each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition. During ordinary non-dream sleep, people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts, and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative. During dream sleep, in contrast, people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression, which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions.[154][failed verification] Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality. Both dream and non-dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory: it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state, and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed.[155]\n\nResearch conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who have partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness.[156][157] In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.\n\nA variety of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, have notable effects on consciousness.[158] These range from a simple dulling of awareness produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics.[152] LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol,[158] but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.[159]\n\nThere has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation. Some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation. It has been disputed, however, whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness.[160]\n\nThe most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist Charles Tart in the 1960s and 1970s. Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of component processes, including exteroception (sensing the external world); interoception (sensing the body); input-processing (seeing meaning); emotions; memory; time sense; sense of identity; evaluation and cognitive processing; motor output; and interaction with the environment.[161][self-published source] Each of these, in his view, could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations. The components that Tart identified have not, however, been validated by empirical studies. Research in this area has not yet reached firm conclusions, but a recent questionnaire-based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug-induced states of consciousness: experience of unity; spiritual experience; blissful state; insightfulness; disembodiment; impaired control and cognition; anxiety; complex imagery; elementary imagery; audio-visual synesthesia; and changed meaning of percepts.[162]\n\nMedical aspects [ edit ]\n\nThe medical approach to consciousness is scientifically oriented. It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs. In medicine, conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments. The medical approach focuses mostly on the amount of consciousness a person has: in medicine, consciousness is assessed as a "level" ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end.[163]\n\nConsciousness is of concern to patients and physicians, especially neurologists and anesthesiologists. Patients may have disorders of consciousness or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure. Physicians may perform consciousness-related interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep, administering general anesthesia, or inducing medical coma.[163] Also, bioethicists may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the Karen Ann Quinlan case,[164] while neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining information about how the brain works.[165]\n\nAssessment [ edit ]\n\nIn medicine, consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as neuropsychological assessment.[89] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands. If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time. A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be "alert and oriented times four" (sometimes denoted "A&Ox4" on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.[166]\n\nThe more complex procedure is known as a neurological examination, and is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting. A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language. The outcome may be summarized using the Glasgow Coma Scale, which yields a number in the range 3–15, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness. The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from "no motor response" to "obeys commands"), the best eye response (ranging from "no eye opening" to "eyes opening spontaneously") and the best verbal response (ranging from "no verbal response" to "fully oriented"). There is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale, for children too young to be able to use language.[163]\n\nIn 2013, an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness, the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse, measuring resulting waves of electrical activity, and developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity.[167]\n\nDisorders [ edit ]\n\nMedical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness.[168] This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes also includes the less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma.[168][169] Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research.[170][171][172] Finally, brain death results in possible irreversible disruption of consciousness.[168] While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they are not included in this category.\n\nDisorder Description Locked-in syndrome The patient has awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and meaningful behavior (viz., eye-movement), but is isolated due to quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy. Minimally conscious state The patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness and displays some meaningful behavior. Persistent vegetative state The patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior. Chronic coma The patient lacks awareness and sleep-wake cycles and only displays reflexive behavior. Brain death The patient lacks awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and brain-mediated reflexive behavior.\n\nMedical experts increasingly view anosognosia as a disorder of consciousness.[173] Anosognosia is a Greek-derived term meaning "unawareness of disease". This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly as a result of a stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them.[174] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the left side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that does not make sense. Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.[175]\n\nOutside human adults [ edit ]\n\nIn children [ edit ]\n\nOf the eight types of consciousness in the Lycan classification, some are detectable in utero and others develop years after birth. Psychologist and educator William Foulkes studied children's dreams and concluded that prior to the shift in cognitive maturation that humans experience during ages five to seven,[176] children lack the Lockean consciousness that Lycan had labeled "introspective consciousness" and that Foulkes labels "self-reflection".[177] In a 2020 paper, Katherine Nelson and Robyn Fivush use "autobiographical consciousness" to label essentially the same faculty, and agree with Foulkes on the timing of this faculty's acquisition. Nelson and Fivush contend that "language is the tool by which humans create a new, uniquely human form of consciousness, namely, autobiographical consciousness".[178] Julian Jaynes had staked out these positions decades earlier.[179][180] Citing the developmental steps that lead the infant to autobiographical consciousness, Nelson and Fivush point to the acquisition of "theory of mind", calling theory of mind "necessary for autobiographical consciousness" and defining it as "understanding differences between one's own mind and others' minds in terms of beliefs, desires, emotions and thoughts". They write, "The hallmark of theory of mind, the understanding of false belief, occurs ... at five to six years of age".[181]\n\nIn animals [ edit ]\n\nThe topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form, because non-human animals, lacking the ability to express human language, cannot tell humans about their experiences.[182] Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a non-physical mind.[183] Most people have a strong intuition that some animals, such as cats and dogs, are conscious, while others, such as insects, are not; but the sources of this intuition are not obvious, and are often based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have observed.[182]\n\nThomas Nagel argues that while a human might be able to imagine what it is like to be a bat by taking "the bat's point of view", it would still be impossible "to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat". (Townsend's big-eared bat pictured.)\n\nPhilosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?". He said that an organism is conscious "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.[184] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent.[185] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive—Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.[138]\n\nOn July 7, 2012, eminent scientists from different branches of neuroscience gathered at the University of Cambridge to celebrate the Francis Crick Memorial Conference, which deals with consciousness in humans and pre-linguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals. After the conference, they signed in the presence of Stephen Hawking, the 'Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness', which summarizes the most important findings of the survey:\n\n"We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the public that is not scientific. It's obvious to everyone in this room that animals have consciousness, but it is not obvious to the rest of the world. It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the Far East. It is not obvious to the society."[186]\n\n"Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals ..., including all mammals and birds, and other creatures, ... have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors."[187]\n\nIn artificial intelligence [ edit ]\n\nThe idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology, appearing for example in the Greek myth of Pygmalion, who carved a statue that was magically brought to life, and in medieval Jewish stories of the Golem, a magically animated homunculus built of clay.[188] However, the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace, in a set of notes written in 1842 about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, a precursor (never built) to modern electronic computers. Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way. She wrote:\n\nIt is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. ... The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with.[189]\n\nOne of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even "Can machines think?" is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the Turing test.[190] To pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a counterargument to each of them. The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate. For example, Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious,[191] while David Chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test, yet fail to be conscious.[192] A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy (of human consciousness compared to human-like consciousness) becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology.[68][69] Jürgen Schmidhuber argues that consciousness is the result of compression.[193] As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment, the compression of this representation can be called consciousness.\n\nJohn Searle in December 2005\n\nIn a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as "the Chinese room argument", John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of "weak AI" that computer programs can be formatted to "simulate" conscious states. His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are. To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols. In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program. Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean. If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve. Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English. Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.[194][195]\n\nIn the literature concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been second only to Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated.[196] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take to make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was "causal powers" of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version,[197] which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.[198]\n\nIn 2014, Victor Argonov has suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on a machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.[199] He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures' consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that a machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine's intellect, not by absence of consciousness.\n\nStream of consciousness [ edit ]\n\nWilliam James is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream, in his Principles of Psychology of 1890.\n\nAccording to James, the "stream of thought" is governed by five characteristics:[200]\n\nEvery thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others.\n\nA similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy, expressed by the Sanskrit term Citta-saṃtāna, which is usually translated as mindstream or "mental continuum". Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.[201] The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events.[201] These triggers are input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations), or a thought (relating to the past, present or the future) that happen to arise in the mind. The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour. The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyzes various phenomena in the world, or analyzes the material body including the organ brain.[201] The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.[201] The purpose of the Buddhist practice of mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.[202]\n\nNarrative form [ edit ]\n\nIn the West, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science: "stream of consciousness as a narrative mode" means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character. This technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of Shakespeare's plays and reached its fullest development in the novels of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, although it has also been used by many other noted writers.[203]\n\nHere, for example, is a passage from Joyce's Ulysses about the thoughts of Molly Bloom:\n\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a well-educated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her.[204]\n\nSpiritual approaches [ edit ]\n\nTo most philosophers, the word "consciousness" connotes the relationship between the mind and the world.[citation needed] To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God, or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world.[citation needed]\n\nThe Canadian psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke, author of the 1901 book Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind, distinguished between three types of consciousness: 'Simple Consciousness', awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; 'Self Consciousness', awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and 'Cosmic Consciousness', awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who have attained "intellectual enlightenment or illumination".[205][third-party source needed]\n\nAnother thorough account of the spiritual approach is Ken Wilber's 1977 book The Spectrum of Consciousness, a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.[206][third-party source needed]\n\nOther examples include the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and Stuart Hameroff.[207][third-party source needed]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nAnimal consciousness – Quality or state of self-awareness within an animal\n\nBicameral mentality – Hypothesis in psychology\n\nChaitanya – Hindu philosophical concept Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n\nClaustrum – Structure in the brain\n\nHabenula – Small bilateral neuronal structure in the brain of vertebrates\n\nModels of consciousness – Aspect of consciousness research\n\nPlant perception – Proposed cognition of plants Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\nSakshi – Pure awareness in Hindu philosophy\n\nVertiginous question – Philosophical argument by Benj Hellie\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]	2025-01-05 19:20:05.159121	2025-01-05 19:20:05.159124	ready	{"topic_key": "url-5493", "chunks_count": 16}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be\nchanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are\nmore disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to\nwhich they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the\nsame object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to\nthrow off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the\npatient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their\nformer systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated\ninjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these\nstates. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended\nin their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended he has utterly neglected to\nattend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those\npeople would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them, and\nformidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the\ndepository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his\nmeasures.\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on\nthe rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the\nlegislative powers, incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the\nstate remaining in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions\nwithin.\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for\nnaturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others, to encourage their migration hither, and raising the\nconditions of new appropriations of lands.\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing\njudiciary powers.\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and\npayment of their salaries.\n\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\n2\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and\neat out their substance.\nHe has kept among us, in time of peace, standing armies, without the consent or our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.\nHe has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and\nunacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation—\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;\nFor protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on\nthe inhabitants of these states;\nFor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;\nFor imposing taxes on us, without our consent;\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;\nFor transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;\nFor abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an\narbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit\ninstrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;\nFor taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the\nforms of our governments;\nFor suspending our own legislature and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in\nall cases whatsoever.\nHe has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\nHe is, at his time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death,\ndesolation and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in\nthe most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their\ncountry, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of\nour frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished\ndestruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\nIn every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our\nrepeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus\nmarked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to\ntime, of attempts by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have\nreminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their\nnative justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to\ndisavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.\nThey, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice, and of consanguinity. We must therefor, acquiesce in the\nnecessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in\nwar, in peace, friends.\nWe, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in general congress assembled,\nappealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by\nthe authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united\ncolonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all\nallegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great\nBritain, is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states may have full\n\n3\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\npower to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and\nthings which independent states may of right do.

The last case study about Warner's randomized response model exemplifies the typical approach\nto statistical inference: We apply the rules of probability to arrive at a point where we can plug in the\ndata in order to estimate the parameters we are interested in.\nAfter having taken a basic probability course such as Stats 117 or CS 109, you should be comfortable\nto work with probability at a slightly more formal level. Such a more careful treatment works with a\nsample space Ω, which is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if you toss a coin twice and\nabbreviate H=heads and T=tails, then Ω = {HH,HT,TH,TT}.\nAn event A is a subset of Ω. In the above example, the event ‘get tails exactly once' is {HT,TH}.\nA probability measure P assigns to each event a number such that\n1. Ρ(Ω) = 1\n2. P(A) ≥ 0 for all events A\n3. P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are disjoint. This has to be also true for an infinite\ncollection of disjoint events A1, A2, . . .: P (∪∞i=1Ai) = ∑∞i=1 P(Ai).\nWith the above rules one can derive all the other rules of probability. For example, in order to\nderive the complement rule one uses that A and Ac are disjoint and that AU AC = Ω. Therefore\n1 = P(Ω) = P(AU Aº) = P(A) + P(Aº)\nand the complement rule follows from rearranging that equation.\nAs a different example, try to derive the following more general form of the addition rule:\nP(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)\nThis more general form does not require that A and B are disjoint; it reduces to the often used\nP(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) in the case where A and B are disjoint. As an alternative way of establishing\nthis rule, you can also employ a Venn diagram.\nFinally, derive the law of total probability: If the events B1,..., Bn are mutually disjoint and\n∪ni=1Bi = Ω (so the Bi form a partition of Ω), then\nn\nP(A) = Σi=1 P(A|Bi)P(Bi)\n1	2025-01-08 22:28:43.156522	2025-01-08 22:28:43.156524	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Lecture 1-5495", "chunks_count": 1}

Let p<sub>n</sub> = <x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>> be the 2-vector\nwhose entries x<sub>n</sub> and y<sub>n</sub> are the proportions of such students of type non-CS and CS respectively at\nthe end of the nth week (so x<sub>n</sub> + y<sub>n</sub> = 1 always).\n(a) (3 points) Among those of type CS at the start of each week suppose 90% remain that way at\nthe end of the week but 10% switch to non-CS. Among those of type non-CS at the start of each\nweek suppose 85% remain that way at the end of the week but 15% switch to CS. Write down an\nexplicit 2 × 2 Markov matrix M for which p<sub>n+1</sub> = Mp<sub>n</sub> for all n.\n(b) (3 points) Using your answer to (a), what proportion of students who are type CS at the end of\na given week are also type CS two weeks later (they may have switched to non-CS and back in\nthe meantime)?\n(c) (4 points) If you computed M correctly then it turns out that to an accuracy of two decimal digits\nfor all m ≥ 17 we have\nM<sup>m</sup> ≈ <0.4, 0.6; 0.4, 0.6>.\nInterpret in words what this means, and also interpret in words the fact (verified by direct calculation) that for any 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 we have\n<0.4, 0.6; 0.4, 0.6> <x, 1-x> = <0.4, 0.6>.\n\nMath 51, Stanford University Copyright © 2024 Stanford University Department of Mathematics.

As a Product\nManager, you'll work closely with our engineers to guide products from conception to launch.\nYou'll bridge technology and business by designing services our customers love, while working\nwith teams across Google like Engineering, Sales, Designers, Marketing, and Finance. You'll be\nresponsible for guiding products throughout the execution cycle, focusing specifically on\nanalyzing, positioning, packaging, promoting, and tailoring our solutions to all the markets\nwhere Google does business. With eyes focused squarely on the future, you'll work closely with\ncreative and prolific engineers to help design and develop technologies that improve access to\nthe world's information. You'll have a bias toward action and can break down complex problems\ninto steps that drive product development at Google speed and scale.\n\nReview\nPreparation\nResources\n\nPreliminary\nAssessment\n45-minute\nphone interview\n\nVirtual Onsite\nInterviews\n3-5 (1 on 1)\nInterviews via\nGoogle Meet\nNumber of interviews\ndependant on whether\nyou're interviewing for\nan internship or\nfull-time role\n\nReview\n\nFinal Offer\nApprovals\n\nWhat products will I work on?\n\nAfter you've accepted an offer and closer to your start, you'll have the opportunity to share\nyour preferences with us. We have openings across all our product lines like Consumer, Mobile,\nApps, Enterprise, and Infrastructure. Your recruiter will explain more about how our team\nmatching process works.\n\n\nPreparation Overview\n\nThe product management interview will largely consist of hypothetical questions and at times a\nfew situational questions focusing on effectively leading end-to-end product roadmaps.\nInterviewers want to know that you can handle the full lifecycle of a product with clear creative\nvision, develop product launch plans, use metrics and data to help drive your decision making,\nunderstand and analyze user needs, motivate cross-functional teams, and conduct research on\nmarkets and competitors.\n\n•\tStrategizing: Begin with showcasing strategic thinking when faced with the initial\nprompt. How are you incorporating this way of thinking throughout your discussion?\n•\tNavigating complexity and ambiguity: How do you deal with ambiguous situations\nand problems? Think about how you would react and make decisions in situations when\nyou have no visibility of the total picture.\n•\tDelivering results: Give examples of what metrics you would use to determine the\nsuccess of a product. How do you evaluate the success or failure of a product? Be\nprepared to discuss how to use data effectively to move critical decisions forward and\nhow to measure impact.\n•\tUser-centric approach: Begin analyzing the needs of the target audience and looking\nfor ways to meet them. What are the problems that the current and target customers\nare facing?\n•\tUse a Structured Approach: Using a framework or structured approach ensures your\nanswers are clear, concise, and easy to follow.\n\nPreliminary Assessment\n\nYou should expect one 45-minute phone interview with a Product Manager focusing on the\nproduct insights, strategic insights, and analytical components - we recommend reviewing\nthese areas in-depth. It's important to note that while there may be a few questions about your\nbackground and previous experiences, the majority of the interview will focus on how you\nthink, communicate, approach problems, and creatively problem solve (or the ability to\ntranscend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful\nnew ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.).\n\nVirtual Onsite Interviews\n\nYou should expect 3-5 (one on one) video interviews via Google Meet (dependent on which\nrole you're interviewing for), focusing on the six components of a Google Product Manager.\nYou will have multiple opportunities across all your interviews to demonstrate skills in these\ncomponent areas. Six Components of a Product Manager\n\n1. Product Insights\nGoogle Product managers should first think about user experiences, start from the customer's\nperspective by using tools and the expertise of others to gather user insights in order to\nunderstand and empathize with user needs, including incorporating users with varied life\nexperiences.\n\nWith the user in mind; create the purpose, value, and perspective of what the product should\nbe over the long-term, and to articulate the vision to stakeholders. Convey a clearly defined\nproduct vision in a way that captures attention and creates a credible plan that compels others\nto action.\n\nFinally, having the ability to combine an understanding of the problem space with a technical\nand business understanding of the options available to address it, and synthesize them into\ncredible solutions. Ability to articulate the solutions across a range of detail depending on the\naudience.\n\n[Sample Questions]\n• How would you improve restaurant search?\n• If you were to build the next great feature for Google Search, what would it be?\n• How would you improve Google Maps?\n• How would you design an alarm clock for a person with a visual impairment?\n\n2. Strategic Insights\nBy incorporating and applying one's understanding of the customer, competitive intelligence,\nexternal trends, and data from lagging/leading metrics, Google's Product Managers can\nsuccessfully establish or adapt strategies. They are able to account for how different strategies\nand decisions impact results of a given product. This could include defining short- and\nlong-term monetization or cost savings opportunities, customer choices/options, and pricing\nstrategies.\n\n[Sample Questions]\n• How would you grow [a certain product] product?\n• Should Google offer a StubHub competitor? That is, sell sports, concert, and theater\ntickets?\n• How would you monetize [a certain product] more effectively?\n\n3. Analytical\nGoogle Product Managers demonstrate an understanding of challenges facing a product,\nabsorbs relevant information, and develops opinionated perspective. This includes\nunderstanding of the product's market/industry, competitors, and product space's underlying\nfunctionalities and capabilities. They are able to articulate solutions across a range of detail.\n\n[Sample Questions]\n• How many messages per second does Gmail receive?\n• You notice a 30% change in usage of your product, what would you do? • As a PM in\nGmail you come in on Monday, take a quick look at the metrics dashboard and see\nreceived emails have dropped 15% last weekend over the weekend(s) before. What do\nyou do?\n\n4. Cross Functional Collaboration\nGoogle's Product Managers work with cross functional teams (marketing, UX, PR, engineering,\netc.) to get things done. They have the ability to effectively address difficult questions, handle\npushback from a high-level audience, and maintain a professional demeanor while engaging in\ndifficult or sometimes high-pressure situations.\n\n[Sample Questions]\n• How do you resolve conflicting product requirements? What or who determines which\nrequirement takes the hit?\n• How would you manage through a latent field failure or bug that is directly impacting\ncustomers and driving return rates up or support contacts?\n• Your largest customer is loudly advocating for a new feature which is not in your\nprioritized roadmap. Sales, eager to please, have gone straight to Engineering to see if\nthey can drop everything and get this done. What do you do?\n\n5. Craft and Execution\nWhile keeping the user in mind, Google's Product Manager's have the ability to strike a balance\nbetween level of detail, prioritization, and execution by being intentional. They demonstrate\ndeep knowledge of the product lifecycle; the overall process for developing, maintaining, and\nevolving products. They are able to differentiate the roles and responsibilities of engineering\nand other functions, major phases, checkpoints, and deliverables. Google PMs understand\ncommon technical and non-technical issues and considerations for launching, updating, or\nsunsetting products. [Sample Questions]\n• Pick a product of your choice. What are the goals of the product? What's in your monthly\nbusiness review deck for the leadership team?\n• You are about to launch a new app that is of strategic importance for the company. 1\nmonth out from launch internal Dogfood suggests the app isn't ready (you are below\ntarget on several key metrics including CSAT). What do you do?\n• Imagine I'm a VC, offering you $20M to build any technology-enabled product/service\nyou'd like. Please walk me through how you would get started? (Problem, Solution, User,\nMonetize, TAM)\n• At what milestone or markers would you look for to determine if a product isn't\nperforming well and what considerations do you make before you sunset the product?\nWhat is the process you would lay out? How do you handle the stakeholders?\n6. [Full-time role only] Googleyness and Leadership\nProduct Managers are assessed not only on core product skills but also on how you get work\ndone and collaborate with others. Interviewers will use a mix of behavioral and hypothetical\nquestions to assess:\nGoogleyness: Share how you work individually and on a team, help others, handle ambiguity,\nand push yourself to grow outside of your comfort zone. Understand what it means to be\nGoogley by reading Google's corporate philosophy and the Google Values.\nLeadership: Be prepared to discuss how you have used your communication and\ndecision-making skills to mobilize others. This might be stepping up to a leadership role in an\ninternship or with an organization, or by helping a team succeed even when you weren;t\nofficially the leader.\nGeneral Interview Tips\nExplain We want to understand how you think, so describe your thought process and\ndecision making throughout the interview. Remember, we're not only evaluating your technical\nability, but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your\ninterviewer to ensure they are reasonable.\nClarify - Many questions will be intentionally open-ended to provide insight into what\ncategories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We're looking to see how\nyou engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk through\nyour thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.\n\nImprove - Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It's worthwhile to think out\nloud about your initial thoughts on a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some\nrefining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve\non it - just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why.\nPractice - Stay current with tech trends and innovations by reading relevant news articles and\nblogs. Understand who your users are. Become comfortable working with frameworks.\nIntegrate these topics in mock interviews.\nDon't Forget\n• Apply a user-centric approach\n• Ask clarifying questions before proceeding\n• Seek out hints if needed\n• Check or validate assumptions\n• Aim to find multiple solutions before choosing the best one\n• Consider new ideas and methods before tackling a problem\n• Remain inventive and flexible in your solutions\n• Be yourself\nConnect with a Googler\nInterested in learning more about what it's like to work at Google? Let your recruiting partner\nknow and they'll set up a phone call with a Googler in your field of expertise for an insider's\nperspective on everything from technology to culture, and more. This call is not an interview, a\ncoaching call or a fit call, but rather an informal 30-minute conversation with volunteers who\nare not part of the hiring process.

No prerequisites or prior knowledge of the Middle East is required. We will begin with the Eurasian context that produced the Safavid and Ottoman empires and quickly move to the rapid transformations of the nineteenth century and imperial dissolution of the early twentieth. Twentieth-century themes include mass migrations, genocides, colonial occupations, nationalisms, revolutions, socialist and Islamist movements, and the role of American policy in the region. The course concludes with placing ongoing anti-colonial and anti-authoritarian liberation movements in regional and global perspective.\n\nLearning Goals: By the end of the course, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify, discuss and represent in writing key turning points in the history of the Modern Middle East from the nineteenth century to the present\n\nSummarize and critique the main historical arguments presented in the textbook and lectures in speech and writing\n\nGenerate historical arguments based on assigned multimedia primary source evidence and express them in speech and writing\n\nHistorically contextualize and evaluate representations of the landscape and inhabitants of the Middle East region in contemporary media in reference to course materials\n\nAssignments and Assessment:\n\n25% Attendance and participation (see below)\n\n20% 4 Canvas short responses (5 points each)\n\n20% In-class midterm \n\n35% Final Paper/Project (varies by course level and credits): topic due by Week 6 (5% of  grade); bibliography by Week 8 (5% of grade)\n\nDetailed Description of Assignments and Evaluation\n\nLecture Attendance and TA-led Section Participation (25%): Attendance and active participation in full-class activities during scheduled lectures, as well as your contributions to discussion in weekly TA-led sessions, are the most important way to engage fully with the course and demonstrate this engagement to the teaching team. Participation in lecture and section is also your chance to bring up relevant issues you think are important. Student participation will be graded based on the following rubric:\n\n9-10 points: Student’s comments show that they have prepared the assigned material by clarifying and articulating the main ideas and arguments expressed in the material and comparing them when relevant. Student’s comments and questions are frequent and often affect the direction of the discussion.\n\n7-8: Student’s comments show that they have engaged with the assigned material. Student’s comments and questions are occasional and sometimes affect the direction of the class discussion.\n\n5-6: Student’s comments and questions sometimes show that they have completed some of the assigned reading. Student’s comments are infrequent and rarely affect the direction of the class discussion.\n\n3-4: Student attends section regularly but does not participate in the discussion.\n\n1-2: Student misses more than two class meetings (see section on Absences) or actively obstructs class discussion.\n\nResponse Blog on Canvas (20%): Within each introductory discussion section during the second week of class, the teaching team will divide students into two groups (A and B).  In Week 3, students in Group A of each section will submit a 250-300-word response paragraph to the relevant discussion topic on Canvas by 8pm two nights before their section meeting.  These response paragraphs should start with a representative or striking quote from the readings and comment on the quote in relation to other reading and lecture material from that week.  We will spend some time workshopping this assignment during lecture in Week 2.  By 8pm the night before their section meeting, students in Group B should write one-two sentence reactions to at least two of their peers’ entries from the previous day.  Weekly due dates for this assignment will vary depending on when sections are scheduled.  Students should read the blog entries and responses before attending their discussion section with Mustafa or Yuanhao. This rhythm will repeat for weeks 3-10, so each group will compose 4 blog entries and respond to peers’ entries 4 times.  Each blog entry and response will be worth 5 points.\n\nIn-Class Midterm Exam (20%): The exam will include a map section, short IDs of people, places and events discussed in lecture, and short essays.  All students must complete the exam in class and contact the teaching team at least 48 hours in advance if conflicts or issues arise.\n\nFinal Project (35%): This assignment will differ depending on how many credits you are taking the course for.\n\nFor three credits, the assignment will be a 1000-1500-word book/film review OR an op-ed reflecting on a recent event in historical perspective. For exemplary book reviews in the field of Middle East history, you are encouraged to consider the reviews sections of the International Journal of Middle East Studies. The course materials contain a number of historically-focused op-eds that you can use as models for your own assignment, especially in Week 10.\n\nFor five credits, you have two options: You may write a research-based essay on the modern history of a place – a city, town, neighborhood, geographic feature, etc. – and how it has been affected by the broad historical trends of the period under study. Alternatively, you may write a biographical essay of a person whose life has been shaped by historical forces in the modern Middle East – this person can be fictional or historical but the essay should reference historical events. The biographical chapters in the recommended book Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East (available online through Stanford libraries) may provide some ideas. Regardless of which you choose, your essay should be between 2500-3000 words, and should include a clear historical argument about how your person or place has changed and which events, personalities, and contextual dynamics have been most important to its trajectory.\n\nFor either credit option, you should communicate your topic to the teaching team by the end of Week 6 (Friday Feb. 17 at midnight) in a 2-3 sentence summary.  By the end of Week 8 (Friday Feb. 28 at midnight) you should submit a list of the sources you plan to use to craft your final project (either for 3 or 5 credits) to your TA.  These communications are worth 5% each, for a total of 10% of your final grade.  Those completing a three-credit essay should include at least 2 scholarly sources you plan to use to craft your final assignment, while those submitting a 5-credit project should include at least 4 sources.  You can include materials reviewed in class in your final project sources, but everyone should include at least 2 sources not reviewed in class. If you are unsure or would like to discuss your topic and appropriate sources, we can either communicate by email or you can schedule an appointment during office hours. A grading rubric for written assignments will be provided on Canvas.  For assistance with descriptive and argumentative writing, you are encouraged to consult the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking: hume.stanford.edu.\n\nDigital Humanities Option: If you are taking the course for 5 credits, you have the option to include a digital data creation/visualization element in your final project. This could be a map of places mentioned in a primary source relevant to your topic, a visualization of quantitative data important to your argument, a digital timeline that expresses your narrative of change over time, or another creation of your choosing. Depending on the amount of labor involved in data creation and visualization, your word-count requirement will be reduced for the written element of the project. Please schedule an appointment with Professor Barakat or your TA as early as possible to discuss ideas if you want to pursue this option. If you have no prior experience in the Digital Humanities but are curious, this is a very good opportunity to learn simple tools.\n\nCommunication: Email is the best way to get in touch with the teaching team, and we will try our best to respond to you within 24 hours. Likewise, you are responsible for checking your email and Canvas for course-related communication.\n\nOffice Hours:  Professor Barakat will hold office hours Thursday afternoons 12:30-2:30pm. You are encouraged to stop by even if you do not have specific questions, and to schedule individual meetings during Weeks 5 and 6 to discuss your final project ideas. You are also encouraged to email Prof Barakat at any point in the quarter for an appointment.\n\nCourse Policies:\n\nRecording and Visitors: In order to create a safe space in the classroom to think and learn with other students, there will be absolutely no recording of class sessions or posting the content of lectures or discussion sections on social media at any time. We expect everyone who comes into the class to act with respect and consideration to each other and the teaching team. Only students who are enrolled are permitted to attend class. Anyone who wishes to attend the class outside of enrollment must email the teaching team for permission.\n\nAbsences and Late Assignments: Attendance in full-class sessions with Prof Barakat and participation in weekly discussion sections with Mustafa or Yuanhao constitutes 25% of your grade. Attendance will be taken in both lectures and discussion sections.  If you will miss more than one discussion section meeting, you should communicate with your TA about the circumstances keeping you from attending.  If you fail to do so, your participation grade will decrease by one-third of a letter grade (A to A-, A- to B+, etc.) for each missed session. Likewise, if you cannot complete a written assignment by the posted due date, you should communicate with your TA about an extension. If you fail to do so, your grade will decrease by one-third of a letter grade every 24 hours after the due date.\n\nAcademic Integrity: You are encouraged to discuss course material and assignments with your peers and workshop each other’s writing. Any work you submit for evaluation, however, must be the result of your own research, writing and/or data creation and must reflect your own approach to the topic. You must also be sure to properly cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, films, etc. that have helped you with your work in accordance with the Chicago Manual of Style. If you received any help with your writing (feedback on drafts, etc.), you must acknowledge this assistance. This includes using generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT): students must acknowledge the use of such tools, describe their use and default to disclosing such assistance when in doubt.  All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code.\n\nStudents with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter dated in the quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nJames L. Gelvin, The Modern Middle East: A History.

ARTICLE I - DEBTS AND EXPENSES \n\n1.1 Debts and Expenses. I direct my Executor to pay my funeral expenses, my medical expenses,  the costs of administration, including ancillary, and such of my enforceable debts, other than those  secured by property specifically devised under this Will or secured by property passing outside of  this Will as my Executor, with sole discretion, determines shall be paid. \n\nARTICLE II - SPECIFIC GIFTS \n\n2.1 Personal Effects. (a) I devise all my clothing, jewelry, personal effects, furniture, furnishings,  household effects, automobiles, boats and other tangible personal property (other than money), to my spouse, Visakha Vajipey.  \n\n(b) If my spouse, Visakha Vajipey, shall not survive me, then I devise such items to my children, Vineeth Vajipey and Vivek Vajipey, per stirpes. Any such property, which my  Executor shall deem not suitable for my child, shall be sold and the proceeds thereof added to the  residue of my estate. All reasonable costs of safekeeping, insuring and shipping my tangible  personal property shall be deemed to be a general estate administration expense. \n\nARTICLE III - RESIDUARY ESTATE \n\n3.1 Spouse Surviving. All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, whether it consists of real,  personal or mixed property, of whatsoever kind or nature, and wheresoever the same may be  situated, of which I may die seized or possessed, to which I may be entitled at the time of my death, I devise to my spouse, Visakha Vajipey. \n\n3.2 Spouse Not Surviving. If my spouse, Visakha Vajipey, shall not survive me, I devise  all the residue of my estate to my Trustee, hereinafter named, IN TRUST, to pay and expend as  much of the net income and principal, as may be necessary in the sole discretion of my Trustee,  for the support and education (including college/university education, both graduate and  undergraduate) of my children, Vajipey Vajipey and Vivek Vajipey, per stirpes, taking into  consideration their other readily available assets and sources of support. \n\nWhen the child of mine who shall live to attain the age of twenty-one (21) years shall attain such  age, my Trustee shall pay over to such child one-half (1/2) of the then remaining principal and any  accumulated income. The remaining one-half (1/2) of all unexpended principal and accumulated\n\n1 \n\nincome shall be held in trust until such child graduates from a four-year accredited college or  university or until such child attains the age of twenty-five (25) years, whichever occurs first, at  which time all unexpended principal and accumulated income shall be paid over to said child. \n\nARTICLE IV - FIDUCIARY APPOINTMENTS \n\n4.1 Appointment of Executor. I appoint my spouse, Visakha Vajipey, to be Executor  under this my Will. If she should fail to qualify or otherwise cease to act as Executor, then I  appoint Ramesh Bhargava to act in her place and stead as the alternate Executor. If Ramesh Bhargavashould fail to qualify or otherwise cease to act as Executor, then I appoint Murty Mallela as the second alternate Executor. \n\n4.2 Appointment of Trustee. In the event my spouse, Visakha Vajipey, shall predecease  me, I appoint Ramesh Bhargava to be Trustee under this my Will. If Ramesh Bhargava should fail  to qualify or otherwise cease to act as Trustee, then I appoint Murty Mallela as the alternate Trustee. \n\n4.3 Guardian. If my children, Vajipey Vajipey and Vivek Vajipey, shall be under the age of  eighteen (18) years, having survived me upon my death, and in the event that Visakha Vajipey has predeceased me, then I appoint Ramesh Bhargava to be Guardian of such person  and property of the minor child of mine. If Ramesh Bhargava should fail to qualify or otherwise  cease to act as Guardian, then I appoint Murty Mallela as the alternate Guardian. No bond  or other security shall be required of a Guardian in any jurisdiction. \n\n4.4 Fiduciary. No Executor and Trustee shall be required to furnish bond or other security in any  jurisdiction. \n\nARTICLE V - FIDUCIARY POWERS \n\n5.1 Fiduciary Powers. My Executor and Trustee (including any substitute or successor Executor and Trustee) shall have the following powers, in addition to, and not in limitation of, those powers given to him/her by law: \n\n(a) To retain any investments or property owned by me at the time of my death or acquired thereafter for so long as shall seem prudent, without restriction to investments authorized by law; \n\n(b) To make repairs, manage, mortgage, lease, improve, alter, abandon or subdivide any real estate  or grant easements with respect thereto, regardless of location, for periods to begin presently or in  the future without regard to any statutory restriction on leasing and even though such period may  extend beyond the term of the estate or of any trust; \n\n(c) To sell or exchange or otherwise dispose of realty or personalty received by them or any investment at or after my death at such time, price and terms, wholly or partly on credit as shall  seem advisable at public or private sale, and exercise stock options, all without notice to any  beneficiary or court approval;\n\n2 \n\n(d) To access, control, use, transfer, distribute, copy, deactivate or delete any of my digital assets;  by granting this power, my executor may act as an account holder and authorized user of my digital  assets; my digital assets include email or other electronic communication, personal or professional  websites, online banking and other financial accounts, frequent flyer accounts and other reward  programs, social media profiles, digital music, photographs or videos, software or any other  electronic record or account; to exercise this power, my executor may access and control any  device or equipment used by me to store or manage my digital assets, such as desktop computers,  laptop computers, tablets, external drives, cell phones or any other device used for access and  control of digital assets that currently exists or may exist as technology develops. \n\n(e) To pay the costs of ancillary and similar proceedings in other jurisdictions from funds or property held in the state of my domicile; \n\n(f) To employ and pay compensation of accountants, legal counsel, brokers and other agents, regardless of their relationship to me or to a fiduciary acting hereunder, and to pay Executor’s and Trustee’s commissions and attorney’s fees on account without beneficiary or court approval, but subject to allowance or disallowance on the settlement of their accounts. \n\n5.2 Accounting. It is my desire to avoid the expense and delay of a public or judicial accounting of the administration of my estate. An accounting by my Executor approved in writing by all the  then current competent beneficiaries of income and principal and the competent beneficiaries who  would be entitled to my estate if it were then to terminate shall be conclusive and binding upon all  persons having an interest in my estate, directly or indirectly. This shall not preclude any fiduciary  from electing to submit an account for judicial settlement. \n\nARTICLE VI - DEFINITIONS \n\n6.1 Survival Presumptions. If any beneficiary and I shall die simultaneously, or under  circumstances which render it difficult or impossible to determine the order of death, then my said  beneficiary shall be deemed to have survived me.  \n\n6.2 Definitions. The singular shall be deemed to include the plural, the masculine the feminine,  and vice versa. Headings and captions are for reference only.  \n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I subscribe my name this 19th day of Dec 2024 at Princeton,  New Jersey. \n\n_____________________________ \n\n Venkat Vajipey\n\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY } \n\n} ss: \n\nCOUNTY OF MERCER } \n\nThe foregoing Instrument was signed, sealed, and published and declared by the above  Testator, Venkat Vajipey, to be the Testator’s Last Will and Testament, in the presence of each of  us, present at the same time, and we, at the Testator’s request and in the Testator’s presence and  in the presence of each other, all being present at the same time, have hereunto subscribed our  names as witnesses, this __19th__ day of December 2024, at _______________, New Jersey. \n\nWe, the Witnesses, sign our names to this Instrument, and, being duly sworn, do hereby  declare to the undersigned authority that the Testator signs and executes this Instrument as the  Testator’s Last Will and Testament and that the Testator signs it willingly, and that each of us, in  the presence and hearing of the Testator, hereby signs this Will as Witness to the Testator’s signing,  and that to the best of our knowledge the Testator is eighteen (18) years of age or older, of sound  mind, and under no constraint or undue influence. \n\n___________________________ residing at ______________________. _________________________     residing at ______________________. \n\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY } \n\n } ss: \n\nCOUNTY OF MERCER } \n\nI, Venkat Vajipey, the Testator, sign my name to this Instrument this 19th day of December  2024, and being duly sworn, do hereby declare to the undersigned authority that I sign and execute  this Instrument as my Last Will and that I sign it willingly, that I execute it as my free and voluntary  act for the purposes therein expressed, and that I am eighteen (18) years of age or older, of sound  mind and under no constraint or undue influence. \n\n______________________________ \n\nVenkat Vajipey \n\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY }\n\n} ss: \n\nCOUNTY OF MERCER } \n\nSubscribed, sworn to and acknowledged before me by Venkat Vajipey, the Testator and  subscribed and sworn to before me by Murty Mallela, and  Lakshmi Mallela, the witnesses, this __19th___ day of December 2024. \n\n_____________________________ \n\nNotary\n\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY } \n\n } ss: \n\nCOUNTY OF MERCER } \n\nI, Venkat Vajipey, the Testator, sign my name to this Instrument this 19th day of December  2024, and being duly sworn, do hereby declare to the undersigned authority that I sign and execute  this Instrument as my Last Will and that I sign it willingly, that I execute it as my free and voluntary  act for the purposes therein expressed, and that I am eighteen (18) years of age or older, of sound  mind and under no constraint or undue influence. \n\n______________________________ \n\nVenkat Vajipey\n\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY }\n\n} ss: \n\nCOUNTY OF MERCER } \n\nSubscribed, sworn to and acknowledged before me by Venkat Vajipey, the Testator and  subscribed and sworn to before me by Murty Mallela, and  Lakshmi Mallela, the witnesses, this __19th___ day of December 2024. \n\n_____________________________ \n\nNotary	2025-01-03 21:56:34.79744	2025-01-03 21:56:34.797442	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-VV_Will_DRAFT rev1-5071", "chunks_count": 5}

In part A. the problem essentially\nasks given there is at least one boy in two children, what is the conditional probability\nthat both children are boys. Part B asks that given one child is a boy, what is the\nconditional probability that the other child is also a boy. For both parts, we need to\nassume that each child is equal likely to be a boy or a girl.\nAll-girl world?\nIn a primitive society, every couple prefers to have a baby girl. There is a 50% chance\nthat each child they have is a girl, and the genders of their children are mutually\nindependent. If each couple insists on having more children until they get a girl and once\nthey have a girl they will stop having more children, what will eventually happen to the\nfraction of girls in this society?\nSolution: It was surprising that many interviewees include many who studied\nprobability have the misconception that there will be more girls. Do not let the word\n"prefer" and a wrong intuition misguide you. The fraction of baby girls are driven by\nnature, or at least the X and Y chromosomes, not by the couples' preference. You only\nneed to look at the key information: 50% and independence. Every new-born child has\nequal probability of being a boy or a girl regardless of the gender of any other children.\nSo the fraction of girls born is always 50% and the fractions of girls in the society will\nstay stable at 50%.\nUnfair coin\nYou are given 1000 coins. Among them, I coin has heads on both sides. The other 999\ncoins are fair coins. You randomly choose a coin and toss it 10 times. Each time, the\ncoin turns up heads. What is the probability that the coin you choose is the unfair one?\nSolution: This is a classic conditional probability question that uses Bayes' theorem. Let\nA be the event that the chosen coin is the unfair one, then A is the event that the chosen\ncoin is a fair one. Let B be the event that all ten tosses turn up heads. Apply Bayes\ntheorem we have P(A/B) =\nP(B|A)P(A)\nP(B|A)P(A)\nP(B) P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A)P(A)\nThe priors are P(A)=1/1000 and P(A)=999/1000. If the coin is unfair, it always\nturns up heads, so P(B|A) = 1. If the coin is fair, each time it has 1/2 probability turning\nA Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews\nup heads. So P(B|A) = (1/2) = 1/1024. Plug in all the available information and we\nhave the answer:\nP(AB) =\nP(B|A)P(A)\n=\n1/1000×1\nP(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A) P(A) 1/1000×1+999/1000×1/1024\n≈\n0.5.\nFair probability from an unfair coin\nIf you have an unfair coin, which may bias toward either heads or tails at an unknown\nprobability, can you generate even odds using this coin?\nSolution: Unlike fair coins, we clearly can not generate even odds with one toss using an\nunfair coin. How about using 2 tosses? Let p₁₄ be the probability the coin will yield\nhead, and py be the probability the coin will yield tails (p₄ + pr=1). Consider two\nindependent tosses. We have four possible outcomes HH, HT, TH and TT with\nprobabilities P(HH) = PHPH P(HT) = PuPc, P(TH) = PrPH, and P(TT) = PrPr\nSo we have P(HT) = P(TH). By assigning HT to winning and TH to losing, we can\ngenerate even odds. 12\nDart game\nVon Neuman algorithm\nJason throws two darts at a dartboard, aiming for the center. The second dart lands\nfarther from the center than the first. If Jason throws a third dart aiming for the center,\nwhat is the probability that the third throw is farther from the center than the first?\nAssume Jason's skillfulness is constant.\nSolution: A standard answer directly applies the conditional probability by enumerating\nall possible outcomes. If we rank the three darts' results from the best (A) to the worst\n(C), there are 6 possible outcomes with equal probability:\n12 I should point out that this simple approach is not the most efficient approach since I am disregarding\nthe cases HH and TT. When the coin has high bias (one side is far more likely than the other side to occur),\nthe method may take many runs to generate one useful result.

C. Huang\nPeople's University of China\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nExisting theories of governance generally focus on formal institutions, con-\nceptualized in an either-or binary of state versus society. Recent archival\nresearch, however, has demonstrated that local Chinese administrative prac-\ntice drew widely on semiformal governance through the use of quasi officials\nnominated by communities. They were not salaried and generated little or no\npaperwork. Once confirmed by the magistrate, they were largely left to func-\ntion on their own; the county yamen intervened only after complaints or in\ndisputes. That mode of administrative practice was born of adaptations, by a\nhighly centralized government that aimed to be as minimalist as possible, to\nthe demands for expanded governance that came with a growing population.\nSubstantial aspects of that legacy from imperial China have persisted through\nthe Republic, the Mao Zedong period, and the present reform era. They may\nbe considered particularly persistent characteristics of the Chinese political\n"tradition," "premodern" and "modern," and they may yet play a role in shap-\ning a distinctive Chinese political modernity.\nKeywords: archival evidence; subcounty government; xiangbao; village\nheads; village education; tax administration; patrimonial bureau-\ncracy; Confucianized Legalism; Mao Zedong period; reform era\nA\nvariety of recently uncovered archival evidence has shown us that, sur-\nprisingly, the basic principles and methods of the Qing civil justice\nsystem were also employed in many other spheres of Qing local gover-\nnance.

Disputes over land, debt, inheritance, and marriage (and old-age\nsupport for one's parents) were deemed to be "minor," first, because in the\nstate's eyes, offenses related to such questions were much less important\nthan criminal acts (and warranted no punishment or only light punishment),\nand, less obviously, because the state thought that such matters were best\nhandled by societal (i.e., community and kin group) mechanisms for dis-\npute resolution rather than by the courts. Most disputes were in fact\nresolved by community or kin mediation.\nNevertheless, many disputes concerning minor matters could not be\nresolved by such means and were taken to court. The state would then rely\nfirst on a semiformal process in which the court system would operate along-\nside the societal mediation that was usually reenergized on the filing of a com-\nplaint. The liaison between the two systems was provided mainly by the xiangbao,\nan unsalaried quasi official nominated by the local community and confirmed\nby the state. In that process, the magistrate generally briefly commented on\ncomplaints, countercomplaints, and petitions as they were received. Those\ncomments were usually either posted or made accessible to the litigants, often\nthrough the xiangbao, and these preliminary expressions of magisterial opin-\nion would play a major role as the mediation proceeded. One or the other side\nmight become more willing to compromise, and a mediated resolution would\nfollow. If such extrajudicial mediation succeeded, the magistrate would\nalmost always prefer it to any possible court action.\nThe semiformal process involving quasi-official intermediaries and\ninteractions between the court system and societal mediation was used so\nwidely as to be routine, almost institutionalized. It resolved perhaps 40 per-\ncent of the total "minor matters" cases filed with the courts. The magistrate\nwould hold a formal court session to adjudicate a dispute only after both the\ninformal and semiformal processes had failed (Huang, 1993a; also see\nHuang, 1996: chap. 5).\nThat basic approach to governance of acting only after complaints and\nof relying as much as possible on informal and semiformal processes-was\napplied, it turns out, not only in the civil justice system but also widely\nthroughout Qing local administration. Unlike modern bureaucratic govern-\nment and its emphasis on routinized supervision and paperwork, the Qing\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Huang / Centralized Minimalism 11\nmethod of local governance by quasi officials and by dispute resolution\nmay be termed "minimalist,” even though governmental power was highly\n"centralized" at the top. I begin this article by briefly summarizing the\naccumulated evidence and then move on to some general observations\nabout the implications of those findings for our understanding of Chinese\ngovernance, past and present.\nThe Evidence\nAlthough county government records for late Qing and Republican\nChina remain relatively scarce because of the devastations of war and rev-\nolution, a number of them did survive largely intact and have been studied\nin some detail in the past two decades. Each documents how the method of\ncivil justice was used in other spheres of administration, including sub-\ncounty tax and educational and judicial administration, village governance,\nand even administration of the county yamen itself. Together, they give us\na coherent picture of what may have been the main methods and distinctive\ncharacteristics of Qing local governance.\nThe Late Qing Baodi County Example\nArchival materials from Baodi county in the late Qing (Baodi xian dang'an,\npreserved in the Qing archives for the capital prefecture of Shuntianfu, held\nat the First Historical Archives in Beijing) tell us about the actual operations\nof subcounty administration in that county, as opposed to the state's designs\nand intentions as manifest in its announced regulations and policies. They\nreveal the pivotal role of the xiangbao, each of whom oversaw tax collection\nand judicial affairs in an average of twenty villages (in this county of some\nnine hundred villages). These xiangbao-unsalaried quasi officials who were\nnominated by and drawn from local society and then confirmed by the state-\nserved as the main liaisons between the county magistrate's yamen and their\ncommunity. They were Janus faced, at once representatives of society and\nagents of the state. They might be the truly powerful leaders of local society\nor just buffers to protect the powerful from state demands; they might be\nadvocates of societal interests or abusers of local society who exploited\ntheir state connections for personal gain. Some xiangbao did little more than\ndeliver messages and information from and to the county yamen, while\nothers wielded considerable influence, even settling disputes on their own author-\nity. Much depended on the local situation and each xiangbao's personality (on tax\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 12 Modern China\ncollection, see Huang, 1985: 224-31; on judicial administration, see Huang,\n1996: 127-31).\nWe know these things not from any paperwork on bureaucratic adminis-\ntrative routines but rather mainly from “cases” involving the appointments\nof xiangbao and complaints against them. The Baodi archives include\nninety-nine cases regarding the appointment or reappointment of xiangbao\nthat span the years 1830 to 1910,¹ sometimes revealing the jockeying\namong local individuals for the post and sometimes the opposite, as indi-\nviduals did everything possible to avoid being named to it. Indeed, in\nnumerous cases nominated xiangbao or existing xiangbao ran away, and\none man even repeatedly paid his would-be nominator extortionate fees to\nkeep himself from being nominated (Huang, 1985: 228). Many instances\ninvolve complaints against xiangbao, generally for tax abuse or for exceed-\ning their authority (e.g., Huang, 1985: 225, 228–30). The record is particu-\nlarly full, for example, on one Tian Kui, who had been removed from office\nfor abuse and then several years later, in 1814, again faced multiple com-\nplaints from local leaders when he attempted to get himself reinstated\n(Baodi xian dang'an, 87, 1814, 12.4; discussed in Huang, 1985: 229).\nAnother xiangbao had been handpicked and installed again and again by a\nbig landlord named Dong Weizeng, who owned 20,000 mu and had relied\non this xiangbao to evade paying taxes on his land. The case came to court\nin 1896 when other local elites joined together to bring a complaint against\nDong and his xiangbao (Baodi xian dang'an, 94, 1896, 5; 1898, 2; 1898,\n7.15; also see Huang, 1985: 230).\nSuch records enable us to form our picture of the xiangbao. Records of\nroutine lawsuits of the county yamen, by contrast, give us only faceless\nxiangbao, ordered by the magistrate in boilerplate language to "look into the\nmatter" or "investigate and report." From the cases and disputes involving the\nxiangbao themselves, we have learned about individual xiangbao-who they\nwere, what they did, and the kinds of conflicts in which they were involved.\nBut past scholarship, including my own, has not yet unearthed from such\nmaterials the distinctive method of governmental administration that is our\nfocus here. In the absence of formal complaints, the xiangbao were left to\noperate on their own, free of official supervision and formal paperwork.\nThey therefore figure little in the routine documentation of the county\nyamen. Substantial records were generated only when the magistrate was\nbrought in because of a complaint against the xiangbao or because of a\nxiangbao's resignation or nomination. In those circumstances, the magis-\ntrate acted much as he did in civil cases. He preferred to allow the dispute\nto be settled by societal mechanisms; but should such mechanisms fail, he\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Huang / Centralized Minimalism 13\nwould render a clear-cut decision. Thus, in cases involving competing and\nunresolvable claims to the position of xiangbao, he would unequivocally\ndecide for one of the candidates; and in persistent disputes involving xiang-\nbao abuses, he would uphold the complaint-acting to discipline or remove\nthe xiangbao-or reject it. The intent was to maintain the system with a\nminimum of bureaucratic effort.\nAs I have shown elsewhere with regard to "civil" lawsuits, the Qing\nmagistrate had little inclination to engage in protracted mediation at court\nto work out voluntary compromises among those whom he saw as lowly\npeople. It took much more time and effort to get the two sides to make vol-\nuntary concessions than it did to adjudicate or decide a case outright.2 And\ngiven the state's approach to "minor matters" as difficulties that it would\nprefer to see society resolve on its own, generally disputes persisted down\nto a formal court session with the magistrate only after both parties had dug\nin their heels and had refused to make the kinds of compromises that soci-\netal mediators had urged on them. Such stubborn cases could rarely be\nresolved easily by magisterial moralizing, no matter how earnest or lofty. In\npractice, administrative expediency, if nothing else, dictated that the mag-\nistrate arrive at a clear-cut resolution of the matter (Huang, 1996; 2006a)—\nan observation no less true of cases involving complaints against the\nxiangbao than of general civil disputes.\nYet such practicalities did not prevent magistrates from continuing to rep-\nresent themselves in their writings or their published case samples in terms of\nthe Confucian ideal, as someone who governed by moral example and moral\nsuasion. And it is really because of those ideological representations that\nsome scholars came to see the magistrate as a moralizing mediator at court.3\nIn fact, most magistrates were careerist bureaucrats who, when confronted\nwith otherwise irresolvable disputes, opted for speedy adjudications. Most,\nduring their relatively brief tenure at a given locale, tried to interfere as little\nas possible and not rock the boat-in other words, they relied as much as they\ncould on informal societal mechanisms and semiformal governance.\nThe Republican Shunyi Example\nIn the Republican period, the Chinese state unquestionably sought to\nexpand its power in a manner commonly associated with “modern state\nmaking" or "bureaucratization" (discussed in more detail below). Thus, the\nGuomindang government sought to deepen its control over rural society by\nextending the state's formal bureaucratic apparatus below the county (xian)\nlevel, down to the newly established subcounty "wards" (qu), each with a\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 14 Modern China\nsalaried ward head (quzhang) backed by formal paperwork, police, and even\nmilitary guards. This important bureaucratizing step came after the reforms\nthat had begun in the New Policy period of the last decade of the Qing, when\nthe state tried to tighten its grasp on rural society by establishing the quasi-\nofficial position of village head (cunzhang) at the level of the natural village\nrather than at the supra-village level as in the earlier xiangbao.\nNevertheless, alongside such twentieth-century bureaucratizing "state making,"\nmuch still remained of the old minimalist approach to grassroots governance.\nHere, as with the Qing, our source of information is mainly paperwork that\nwas generated only when the new village heads were appointed or dismissed\nor were made the object of complaints. One notable batch of such materials\ncomes from Shunyi county in Hebei, involving a total of eighty-eight petitions\nabout village heads filed with the Shunyi county government in the years 1929\nto 1931. Of those, seventy were from existing or nominated village heads who\nasked to be allowed to resign (Shunyi xian dang'an, 3:42 and 50, 1929.1–12;\n3:170, 1930.9-1931.9). Six others were complaints against abuses by existing\nvillage heads, mainly in connection with their handling of taxes. The remain-\nder consisted of five petitions submitted by other village leaders to nominate\na new village head, five reporting deaths of village heads and the need for a\nnew appointment, and two odd cases.4\nThese records tell us that the method of administration revealed in the\nBaodi records about the xiangbao was still commonly used in village gov-\nernance. Like the xiangbao, each village head was nominated by local nota-\nbles and confirmed by the county magistrate. Not a salaried official, he was\nmore a representative of the village community than an official of the state.\nAnd he was pretty much left alone to perform his functions until and unless\ncomplaints arose or a new village head needed to be appointed (Huang,\n1985: 241-44).\nThe spate of petitions to resign resulted from the new stresses on village\ngovernment beginning in the late 1920s because of Guomindang attempts\nto tighten control and increase taxes, especially the miscellaneous levies-\nmost importantly for police and military guard units and for schools-\nknown collectively as the tankuan. The new state wanted to reach directly\ninto natural villages through the village head, whereas the Qing state had\nattempted in Baodi county to exert its power via the xiangbao (overseeing,\nas noted above, about twenty villages each). The new state wished to hold\nthe new village heads, not the xiangbao as in the Qing, responsible for tax\ncollection. The new state sought to impose more taxes for modernizing\nreforms to establish a modern police and school system-whereas the\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Huang / Centralized Minimalism 15\nQing state had for two centuries tried to leave things much as they were.\nFinally, during times of the Guomindang wars with warlords, armies pass-\ning through strategic locations would require villages to provide food, ani-\nmals, lodging, manpower, and the like for logistical support (Huang, 1985:\n278-80, 284-85, 288–89).\nThese new pressures were what many existing and prospective village\nheads sought to avoid. Some used the excuse of old age and infirmity or\npoor health, others pled illiteracy or inadequate ability or qualifications,\nand still others pointed to outside responsibilities and obligations. In sev-\neral instances, a newly nominated village head turned right around to nom-\ninate someone else, who in turn submitted a petition insisting that the one\nnominated first was the better qualified for the honor. Many of the peti-\ntioners begging off from service as village heads referred to the increased\nburdens of the office in connection with the new taxes, and several men-\ntioned the military requisitions.\nThese materials confirm that village governance under the Guomindang in\nmany respects changed little from that shown in the Qing Baodi archives. Just\nas the Qing state had done with the xiangbao, the new Guomindang state\ndrew personnel from the locality itself, requiring that indigenous leaders\nnominate the village head from among the members of the community.\nRather than appointing or assigning such village heads, the state limited its\nrole to confirming nominations from the communities themselves. The new\nvillage heads, moreover, were to serve as unsalaried quasi officials, just as the\nxiangbao had been. And also like the xiangbao, village heads so chosen were\nleft to carry out their functions essentially on their own so long as tax expec-\ntations were met, until and unless they became targets of complaints or until\nthey tried to resign or asked to be replaced. Thus, complaints against them\nand petitions from them are our main source of information about them.\nFor the 1930s and early 1940s, the oral histories of Japanese Mantetsu\n(South Manchurian Railway Company) field researchers both substanti-\nate and flesh out the archival records. Thus, the six North China villages\nsurveyed by Mantetsu researchers from 1939 to 1942 illustrate in con-\ncrete detail three patterns resulting from this minimalist approach to vil-\nlage governance. From oral histories, and not from the county archives,\nwe know that in Houxiazhai and Lengshuigou in northwest Shandong,\nearlier village heads, who had been nominated by community leaders,\nlargely continued to serve through the 1930s and early 1940s. They gen-\nerally represented village interests more than state concerns, and their\ncommunities dealt with the state as cohesive units. These were villages\nThis content downloaded from\n132.174.251.2 on Thu, 11 Apr 2024 23:09:19 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms	2025-01-06 06:35:44.277668	2025-01-06 06:35:44.27767	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Huang-CentralizedMinimalismSemiformal-2008-2870", "chunks_count": 9}

Joint distributions arise naturally in many\napplications, of which the following are illustrative:\n• In ecological studies, counts of several species, modeled as random variables, are\noften made. One species is often the prey of another; clearly, the number of predators\nwill be related to the number of prey.\n• The joint probability distribution of the x, y, and z components of wind velocity\ncan be experimentally measured in studies of atmospheric turbulence.\n• The joint distribution of the values of various physiological variables in a population\nof patients is often of interest in medical studies.\n• A model for the joint distribution of age and length in a population of fish can be used\nto estimate the age distribution from the length distribution. The age distribution is\nrelevant to the setting of reasonable harvesting policies.\nThe joint behavior of two random variables, X and Y, is determined by the\ncumulative distribution function\nF(x, y) = P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y)\nregardless of whether X and Y are continuous or discrete. The cdf gives the probability\nthat the point (X, Y) belongs to a semi-infinite rectangle in the plane, as shown in\nFigure 3.1. The probability that (X, Y) belongs to a given rectangle is, from Figure 3.2,\nP(x1 < X ≤ x2, y1 < Y ≤ y2) = F(x2, y2) – F(x2, y1) – F(x1, y2)\n+ F(x1, y1)\n71\n\n72\nChapter 3 Joint Distributions\ny\nb\nX\na\ny\nУ2\nУ1\nX\nX1\nX2\nFIGURE 3.1 F (a, b) gives the probability of the\nshaded rectangle.\nFIGURE 3.2 The probability of the shaded\nrectangle can be found by subtracting from the\nprobability of the (semi-infinite) rectangle having\nthe upper-right corner (x2, y2) the probabilities of\nthe (x1, y2) and (x2, y1) rectangles, and then adding\nback in the probability of the (x1, y1) rectangle.\nThe probability that (X, Y) belongs to a set A, for a large enough class of sets\nfor practical purposes, can be determined by taking limits of intersections and unions\nof rectangles. In general, if X1, ..., Xn are jointly distributed random variables, their\njoint cdf is\nF(x1, x2,..., xn) = P(X1 ≤ X1, X2 ≤ X2,..., Xn ≤ Xn)\nTwo- and higher-dimensional versions of density functions and frequency func-\ntions exist. We will start with a detailed description of such functions for the discrete\ncase, since it is the easier one to understand.\n3.2 Discrete Random Variables\nSuppose that X and Y are discrete random variables defined on the same sample\nspace and that they take on values X1, X2, ..., and y1, y2, ..., respectively. Their\njoint frequency function, or joint probability mass function, p(x, y), is\np(xi, yj) = P(X = Xi, Y = yj)\nA simple example will illustrate this concept. A fair coin is tossed three times; let X\ndenote the number of heads on the first toss and Y the total number of heads. From\nthe sample space, which is\nΩ = {hhh, hht, hth, htt, thh, tht, tth, ttt}\n\n3.2 Discrete Random Variables 73\nwe see that the joint frequency function of X and Y is as given in the following table:\ny\nX\n0\n1\n2\n3\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n10\n1\n1\nThus, for example, p(0, 2) = P(X = 0, Y = 2) = . Note that the probabilities\nin the preceding table sum to 1.\nSuppose that we wish to find the frequency function of Y from the joint frequency\nfunction. This is straightforward:\npy(0) = P(Y = 0)\n= P(Y = 0, X = 0) + P(Y = 0, X = 1)\n1\n-+0\n8\n1\n18\npy(1) = P(Y = 1)\n= P(Y = 1, X = 0) + P(Y = 1, X = 1)\n=\n3-8\nIn general, to find the frequency function of Y, we simply sum down the appropriate\ncolumn of the table. For this reason, py is called the marginal frequency function\nof Y. Similarly, summing across the rows gives\nPx(x) = ∑ p(x, yi)\ni\nwhich is the marginal frequency function of X.\nThe case for several random variables is analogous. If X1, ..., Xm are discrete\nrandom variables defined on the same sample space, their joint frequency function is\np(x1,..., Xm) = P(X₁ = X1,..., Xm = Xm)\nThe marginal frequency function of X1, for example, is\nPx₁ (x1) = ∑ P(X1, X2, ..., Xm)\nX2Xm\nThe two-dimensional marginal frequency function of X₁ and X2, for example, is\nPX1X2 (X1, X2) = ∑ P(X1, X2, ..., Xm)\nX3Xm\nEXAMPLE A Multinomial Distribution\nThe multinomial distribution, an important generalization of the binomial distribution,\narises in the following way. Suppose that each of n independent trials can result in\n\n74\nChapter 3 Joint Distributions\none of r types of outcomes and that on each trial the probabilities of the r outcomes\nare P1, P2,..., p. Let N; be the total number of outcomes of type i in the n trials,\ni = 1, . . ., r. To calculate the joint frequency function, we observe that any particular\nsequence of trials giving rise to N₁ = n1, N2 = n2,..., N₁ = n, occurs with\nprobability p¹ p22 ... pr. From Proposition C in Section 1.4.2, we know that there\nare n!/(n₁!n2!···n,!) such sequences, and thus the joint frequency function is\nn2\np(n₁,...,n.)\n=\n(n)\nnr\nppp\nThe marginal distribution of any particular N; can be obtained by summing the joint\nfrequency function over the other nj. This formidable algebraic task can be avoided,\nhowever, by noting that N; can be interpreted as the number of successes in n trials,\neach of which has probability p₁ of success and 1 pi of failure. Therefore, N; is a\nbinomial random variable, and\nn\nPN; (ni)\nni\n=\np (1\nPi)n-ni\nni\nThe multinomial distribution is applicable in considering the probabilistic prop-\nerties of a histogram. As a concrete example, suppose that 100 independent ob-\nservations are taken from a uniform distribution on [0, 1], that the interval [0, 1] is\npartitioned into 10 equal bins, and that the counts n₁, . . ., N 10 in each of the 10 bins are\nrecorded and graphed as the heights of vertical bars above the respective bins. The joint\ndistribution of the heights is multinomial with n = 100 and p₁ = .1, i = 1, ..., 10.\nFigure 3.3 shows four histograms constructed in this manner from a pseudorandom\n16\n20\n12\n15\n8\n10\n4\n5\n0\n0\n0 2.4.6.8 1.0\n0\n2.4.6 .8 1.0\nX\nX\n(a)\n(b)\n16\n20\n12\n15\n8\n10\n4\n5\n0\n0\n0\n.2\n.4.6\n.8 1.0\n0\n.2\n.4\n.6 .8 1.0\nX\nX\n(c)\n(d)\nFIGURE 3.3 Four histograms, each formed from 100 independent uniform random\nnumbers.\n\n3.3 Continuous Random Variables 75\nnumber generator; the figure illustrates the sort of random fluctuations that can be\nexpected in histograms.\n3.3 Continuous Random Variables\nSuppose that X and Y are continuous random variables with a joint cdf, F(x, y). Their\njoint density function is a piecewise continuous function of two variables, f (x, y).\nThe density function f(x, y) is nonnegative and ∫ ∫x f(x, y)dy dx = 1. For\nany "reasonable” two-dimensional set A\nP((X, Y) ∈ A) =\nJS\nA\nf(x, y) dy dx\nIn particular, if A = {(X, Y)|X ≤ x and Y ≤ y},\nF(x, y)\n=\nSS\n81\n81\nf(u, v) dv du\nFrom the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus, it follows that\na2\nf(x, y) = F(x, y)\nдхду\nwherever the derivative is defined.\nFor small 8x and dy, if f is continuous at (x, y),\nP(x ≤ X ≤ x + 8x, y < Y < y + бу)\n=\nх+х ру+бу\nfa+ds + f (u, v) dv du\nX\ny\n≈ f(x, y)dxdy\nThus, the probability that (X, Y) is in a small neighborhood of (x, y) is proportional\nto f (x, y).

The joint density function is a function of several variables, and the\nmarginal density functions are found by integration. There are marginal density\n\n3.3 Continuous Random Variables 77\nfunctions of various dimensions. Suppose that X, Y, and Z are jointly continuous\nrandom variables with density function f(x, y, z). The one-dimensional marginal\ndistribution of X is\nfx(x)\n=\n.00\n81\n81\nf(x,\n, y, z) dy dz\nand the two-dimensional marginal distribution of X and Y is\nfxy(x, y)\n=\nf(x, y, z) dz\n18\nEXAMPLEC Farlie-Morgenstern Family\nIf F(x) and G(y) are one-dimensional cdfs, it can be shown that, for any a for which\n|α ≤ 1,\nH(x, y) = F(x)G(y){1+a[1 – F(x)][1 – G(y)]}\nis a bivariate cumulative distribution function. Because lim F(x) = lim F(y) = 1,\nthe marginal distributions are\nx→∞\ny→∞\nH(x, ∞) = F(x)\nH(∞, y) = G(y)\nIn this way, an infinite number of different bivariate distributions with given marginals\ncan be constructed.\nAs an example, we will construct bivariate distributions with marginals that are\nuniform on [0, 1] [F(x) = x,0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and G(y) = y, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1]. First, with\na = -1, we have\nH(x, y) = xy[1 – (1 – x)(1 – y)]\n= x²y + y²x – x²y²,\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1,\n0≤ y ≤1\nThe bivariate density is\nh(x, y) =\n22\nH(x, y)\nдхду\n= 2x + 2y - 4xy,\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1,\n0≤ y ≤1\nThe density is shown in Figure 3.5. Perhaps you can imagine integrating over y\n(pushing all the mass onto the x axis) to produce a marginal uniform density for x.\nNext, if a = 1,\nH(x, y) = xy[1 + (1 − x)(1 – y)]\n= 2xy - x²y – y²x + x²y²,\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0≤ y ≤1\nThe density is\nh(x, y) = 2 - 2x – 2y + 4xy,\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1,\n0≤ y ≤1\nThis density is shown in Figure 3.6.\nWe just constructed two different bivariate distributions, both of which have\nuniform marginals.\n\n78\nChapter 3 Joint Distributions\n0.8\ny 0.6\n0.2\n0.4\n1\n0\n2\n1.5\nh(x, y)\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nX\n1\nFIGURE 3.5 The joint density h(x, y) = 2x + 2y – 4xy, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and\n0 ≤ y ≤ 1, which has uniform marginal densities.\n1\n0.8\ny 0.6\n0.2\n0.4\n02\n1.5\nh(x, y)\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nX\n1\nFIGURE 3.6 The joint density h(x, y) = 2 – 2x – 2y + 4xy, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and\n0 ≤ y ≤ 1, which has uniform marginal densities.\nA copula is a joint cumulative distribution function of random variables that have\nuniform marginal distributions. The functions H (x, y) in the preceding example are\ncopulas. Note that a copula C(u, v) is nondecreasing in each variable, because it\nis a cdf. Also, P(U < u) = C(u,1) = u and C(1, v) = v, since the marginal\ndistributions are uniform.

then her hazel brown eyes would light up with the same warmth of the hearth flame that illuminated her face, and she’d make her way over to the sofa where I was, snuggle up against my shoulder, make the words on the page come to life, and I would be filled.\nIt was my facial expressions, my hand gestures, the slightest glances to the left and to the right, she understood all of it, it took no effort on her part and was so extraordinary that she very well may have been reading not the story in the book, but rather the inscriptions of my soul.\nYou told me yourself that even you couldn’t come close to comprehending me in that way.\nBut then she’d be turning the pages, and I’d remember that every good story has an end, that her gift was a crutch I would one day have to set to the side so I could stand on my own two feet, and I’d feel empty again.\nIt has been a long time since I have heard you tell us anything.\nWhen we were ten, you had to go back to China.\nWàipó fell ill with [fill in specific] and needed your care.\nI also remember how hard it was for you when you lost your job in the states.\nThe one you found near Wàipó’s home was so much better than anything you could find here.\nI know it was a long and difficult decision, but eventually you found a caretaker to look after us and left the country.\nI’m sure anyone would’ve done the same if they were in your position.\nBesides, it let you be closer to Bàba.\nI don’t know much about him since he died when I was three, but I know you missed him very much.\nIt must be hard, taking care of Wàipó while providing for two children on the other side of the globe without his help.\nWhen money was running tight, Faith called you and said we didn’t need a caretaker anymore.\nShe said that she could take care of me, and that she could take care of herself.\nI know I can’t call you, Māma, but I should have texted you more than I did.\nSo I’m sorry.\nIt was the day you left, that at some point it was just you and me alone in the living room while Faith was in the bedroom doing a last check of the bags to make sure everything was ready for your long journey across the Pacific.\nDon’t get into trouble, don’t forget to text me.\nAnd take care of your sister, you told me.\nYou know I’ve always had good ears, and I could tell your words were slightly more hollow on the third instruction.\nIt was an unspoken and shared assumption that it was always going to very much be the other way around; I hated it nonetheless.\nBut it was after that, the last thing you told me before you left, that made quite the profound impression on me.\nWǒ ér zi, you told me, with a voice I have not heard so somber since the Saturday you picked out white chrysanthemums for Bàba’s funeral.\nWith li\nlight\nmust\ncome\nyour\nshadow.\nKeep it.\nNow, seven years later, I must tell the story of how I failed, that though I always listened it wasn’t in my nature to understand, but the words will still stick with me, like my shadow they will follow me to the very end, they always do, because I remember everything that I hear.\n*\n*\n*\nFirst, you must know what life has been like since you were gone.\nIn the mornings, I would wake up and find a small breakfast on the kitchen counter, prepared by Faith who had gotten up earlier to catch a phone call with you before you went to sleep.\nIt would usually be a lightly toasted bagel with a thin layer of butter melted on the inside, just the way I liked it.\nBut sometimes, if Faith had extra time that morning, she’d prepare a bowl of rice with a couple of fried eggs and a little drizzle of soy sauce, just the way you used to.\nShe’s a great learner; you were proud of her for that.\nI’d knock on her door after I finished eating, and then we would walk to school together.\nYou said to us to always walk to and from school together and at that point I didn’t really know why, but for the longest time we did.\nLast winter when I was bedridden with the flu, Faith stayed home and took care of me until I could leave the house again.\nWhenever the vocal teacher held her up for an extra half hour after school, I always waited.\nThat was our thing, to and fro through winter mornings and summer afternoons.\nI preferred hot weather and Faith preferred cold weather, like you.\nIt let her wear her favorite oversized hoodie.\nWe went to a small high school, about a fifteen minute walk from our home.\nNot much has changed in our sparse suburban town, so we were aware of most of the people at our school from the many years spent together in grade school and middle school.\nA few of us never matured, like the boys in the black bandanas, but the rest of us slowly transformed, as the sands of time weathered us like stones in the storm of a harsh desert, the grip of reality threatening to pry away the magic of our childhood.\nIt was jarring to me to see how the fastest runner in our grade so abruptly lost his hubris after a knee injury that forced him to drop athletics, or how the smartest girl in my math class struggled to pass her exams after her father lost his job, as she had to spend her studying hours searching for paid work.\nBut they were all strong individuals, and they adapted to their surroundings as they shifted with the seasons.\nThe boy found a new interest in our school’s associated student body, and now he is class president.\nThe girl has a waitlist of precalculus students pursuing her tutoring, offering rates I didn’t previously think were possible for this kind of job.\nI wonder if this is what the gods saw, when they witnessed with their own eyes the evolution of species.\n[Work in Progress]\n*\n*\n*\nOn the morning of my seventeenth birthday, I woke up with an idea.\nIt took place on a Sunday.\nThat morning Faith took me to Zheng’s, a local bakery that had opened up a few blocks away a couple of years after you left.\nI knew you had always hoped that our town would eventually have a new Chinese bakery after the old one closed down.\nYou told me that when we were really young, Faith loved red bean bread and hated egg tarts, and that I loved egg tarts and hated red bean bread, and I can tell you that we still do.\nWe always came here each year for whatever few special occasions we celebrated.\nI usually like chocolate cakes, but that day I instead pointed at one of the last strawberry cakes behind the glass, so Faith went up to the cashier and ordered it for me.\nThat strawberry cake please.\nIt’s for my brother’s birthday!\nOh, happy birthday to him then!\nHe handed Faith the receipt.\nThank you for coming.\nHave a nice day!\nAs we were leaving the store I thought about how he managed to say all of this without even looking at me.\nWhen we got home I went to the bookshelf by the fireplace and picked out one of the older books, the one with the Chinese folktales that you read to us when we were five.\nThere was a story in there that I wanted to hear again, so I opened to the right page and motioned to Faith to come sit next to me on the sofa.\nAnd so she read.\nShe read about how the hero archer Hòu Yì had shot down nine of the ten suns to save the Earth from being scorched, and how the goddess Xīwángmǔ had rewarded him with an elixir of immortality.\nHow he didn’t want to drink the potion so he gave it to his wife, Cháng’é, to protect.\nHow one of his apprentices tried to steal the elixir, and how Cháng’é drank it to stop him from taking it.\n“After she drank the potion, she rose up to the moon.\nWhen Hòu Yì found out what had happened, he was so sad he left fruits and cakes she liked in the yard every year.\nThe Chinese people sympathized with the hero and made offerings to Cháng’é also.\nThat’s why we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.”\nI tilted my head and pointed at the sky.\nDo you think she can see us celebrating?\nFrom all the wa\nway up there?\n“Of course! I’m sure she’s happy about everything we’re doing for her.”\nBut we can’t see her.\nHow do we know if she’s even there?\n“She’s there. The story says she’s immortal, remember?”\nDo you think it gets lonely up there?\nWhat if she wanted to tell us something?\n“She would find a way. I think she’d send us a sign or something.”\nI wanted to ask But what if she can’t but I just glanced out the window instead.\nI saw a little white crescent.\nThere was either someone there looking at us that I couldn’t see, or no one there at all, but I couldn’t tell.\nI turned off the lights in the kitchen and Faith lit up seventeen candles for the cake.\nShe wrapped her arms, covered by the sleeves of her oversized hoodie, around me.\n“Happy Birthday. Look at what I got you!”\nShe held up to me a beautiful ballpoint pen.\nThe nose cone was a lustrous golden and the barrel jet black.\nIt felt smooth in my hand, and moving its tip across the page gives satisfaction to my fingers.\nIt’s easy to describe, because it’s the same pen with which I am writing to you.\nI saw Faith smile at me from across the kitchen counter.\nFaith always says I don’t smile very much and I should smile more, that she loves my smile.\nSo I smiled back, but not just for her.\nI smiled because sitting across from me was someone whose offering I held in my hand and she could see me and I could see her, and that was enough.\nI saved this memory in my mind as one does money in a bank for retirement.\nI saved it, for these highs of happiness are too rare and end too quickly and I know later I will be shrouded in a cloud of darkness and need something to grasp onto, anything to drag me out.\nDo you know about the cloud, Māma?\nEveryone else in this world seems able to run like machines off these little highs and I don’t know how they do it and every time I can’t do anything about it the cloud just comes back, it reminds me that happiness is just a distraction from how much the world really sucks, it slows the turning of my gears until all I want to do is curl up under the covers and sleep.\nIt’s hard to reach into my mind and withdraw the memories I’ve saved, because now they have turned against me.\nThey stab me in the back.\nBut who is to blame but me.\nAs I blew out the candles, I made my wish.\nI made a wish to be heard.\nThat’s why I requested Faith to perform with me at the school talent show next month.\n[Work in Progress]\n*\n*\n*\nIn the coming weeks I picked up that pen and put it to good use.\nI spent night after night at our piano, trying chords and forming lines, and slowly it came together.\nI wanted to write about the true, the good, and the beautiful, just the way everyone would like it.\nSo I wrote about Cháng’é, and about how the moon was her cell of solitary confinement.\nI wrote about how lonely it was for her to look everyday outside her cell, but for no one else to be able to look back in.\nThen, just when she’s about to go insane from solitude, he appears - her beloved Hòu Yì comes to the moon, and they live happily ever after.\nOf course that didn’t happen and it’s naive, thinking about it now, but at the time the song made sense in my head.\nThe day of the talent show started the same as all the others.\nFaith called you and I ate a bagel and we walked to school together.\nI went to math then I went to English and when the lunch bell rang the other students pushed past me in the hallway like I was one of the cubes in a foam pit.\nLike every other day I ate lunch with Faith and Faith only and of course the black bandana boys came over and mocked us but I ignored them because of what they didn’t know.\nThey didn’t know that I didn’t have a care in the world for what they said, because today was my festival and soon I would be at the top of this Earth with all eyes on me as Faith says out loud the first words I never had.\nI dreamed in plain daylight about the future those words would give me, Māma.\nI spent the rest of the afternoon anticipating that stage.\nI saw the piano, illuminated by the lights that promised to make visible the invisible ink that coated my skin.\nI saw the microphone, from which I could already hear Faith singing my song.\nI saw the audience of a thousand awestruck faces and though it’s a little blurry, if I tried hard enough I could see you, sitting front and center, looking at me with the same pride that previously only my sister could give you.\nI think you would know how I felt.\nThe visions ran like a drug through my mind as I imagine they once did yours.\n[Work In Progress]\n*\n*\n*\nSorry.\nI etch that final word onto the paper, before signing off.\nI love you.\nThen, after a moment of extra thought.\nPlease forgive me.\nI graze down all the pages one last time before I fold and tuck them into a white envelope.\nA tag that says Send to Mother goes on the flap of the envelope.\nThe envelope goes in a little box with the mooncake I bought from Zheng’s with leftover pocket change.\nThe box goes on the floor at the foot of Faith’s door.\nShe doesn’t open that door\nvery much anymore.\nThere was something I hadn’t included in the letter.\nAfter I walked home alone, I shut up in my room.\nFaith didn’t come home that night.\nWhen I knocked on her door the next morning for school, there was no response.\nIt was only later, after I left school, that I learned of the horrible thing that had happened, otherwise I would’ve beaten the black bandana boys’ heads in, or at least tried.\nTo describe a flower being taken, and its petals ripped from it.\nWriting it feels like digging the tip of the pen into my own heart.\nIt is something I cannot put in words, even on paper.\nThey were taken in, and I still know not what their sentences will be.\nAll the while my sister is locked up in the jail cell of her own room.\nFaith: a name, a word whose only meaning to me now is all that has been taken from me.\nNo; rather, everything I have done to lose.\nI remember that night deciding to push open her door after countless knocks, and I saw her with used tissues which had tried fruitlessly to wipe away the anguish and sorrows from her eyes.\nEyes from which I expected to see anger or even fear when they saw me, but instead I only saw love, love that pained me so much I wish she just screamed at me to leave instead.\nHow could you.\nHow could you love me.\nHow could you love someone who let this happen to you.\nI’m so sorry.\nI can’t imagine what you are going through right now.\nDo you want me

I finished it in a cafe, right about the same time I finished my coffee and my cherry cake. The cafe is in a beach town in Japan, where I have been for a very long time. Soon enough I’ll go home.\n\nWhen I say I have been here for a very long time, I mean that. I’ve been here for six months, which doesn’t sound very long until you remember that I’m twenty years old and that when you’re twenty years old six months can be a lifetime. A lot can change in six months. You can do a lot. You can get sick. You can get better. You can buy umbrellas. You can lose them. You can make friends. You can lose them. You can fall in love, and you can lose the love. You can find yourself. You can lose that, too.\n\nThere was a girl I met here, and after every date we would go for a walk. We went on a lot of walks together, just the two of us. I think it was five walks but each walk was very long and because they were the longest walks I had ever been on, just the two of us, we walked very far and covered a lot of distance. At least I did. I don’t think she moved very much if I’m being perfectly honest, but that’s okay. I moved enough for the both of us.\n\nWhen you think about it five walks is not a lot of walks. And at the end of the fifth walk it became very clear to me that the last one hadn’t been a real walk but a fake one, that like a lot of final moments it only meant something as an echo of previous moments and couldn’t stand up on its own.\n\nIt would be okay except I have a problem. I dream about her quite often. I’ll be falling asleep on the train and suddenly I’ll be dreaming about her. Or I’ll wake up early in the morning with barely enough energy to drag myself on that miserable walk to work, and I’ll realize I spent the whole night dreaming about her.\n\nI’m not sure what to do about it to be honest because I realized quite a long time ago that it wasn’t going to happen and I was sad for a while and then I was less sad for a while and then I suppose I was back to normal. So no matter how much I think about it, I can’t seem to figure out why I dream about her so often, or what to do. We don’t even have sex in the dreams, either. That would be normal I think. In the dreams we just sit next to each other and talk, or walk and talk, or go to some building and talk. We don’t talk about much.\n\nI think I might be in love with her, or at least some part of me wants me to think I am, which is especially odd because I don’t think I know anything about her. And I’m confident she doesn’t know anything about me. But I know that a very subtle, very attractive accent creeps into her voice when she says sorry, and that when she’s eating it matters to her if I’m eating too, and that every so often her smile gets so sweet the rest of the world looks bitter by comparison.\n\nI think if I had someone to talk to I wouldn’t have fallen in love with her, which probably means I never really did. But boys like me aren’t supposed to feel like this. I know that much for sure.\n\nWhen I finished *A Farewell to Arms* and my coffee and my cherry cake today in a cafe in Japan I almost cried, and though I didn’t I guess I looked very sad because the fat French man sitting at the table next to me kept looking over at me as if he were confused. I’m cursed with big eyes. Boys like me aren’t supposed to have feelings like this, but when they do they especially aren’t supposed to look like they have them. It’s off-putting. But when I get emotional I look it, and since people aren’t trained to recognize sadness in a face like mine they assume my face is wrong for some other reason. Trust me, I’m a good read of faces. Mine can be very off-putting.\n\nI like to think my best quality as a writer is that I’m honest. No matter what I write I’m honest. Even when I’m lying I’m telling the truth, and because I spend every moment of every day lying I really know what it means to tell the truth. But it’s a double-edged sword. When I’m being honest even though I am still lying I also have to tell the truth, and when I tell the truth everyone can see how much I’ve been lying, so I have to write pieces like this and keep them hidden somewhere no one will see. It’s a real problem. I’m cursed with big eyes.\n\nAnyway in this book, *A Farewell to Arms*, a man falls in love with a woman and she gets pregnant and has a baby and both she and the baby die in childbirth and that’s the ending. You might be mad at me for spoiling it right now, but I promise you’ll forget because endings don’t stick in the mind if you didn’t spend any time with the middle. Endings are just words. You know they’re coming and you know nothing is coming after that, so just like how the middle only matters because you’re on the way to an ending an ending doesn’t matter because there’s nothing coming next.\n\nI’ve been in Japan for six months, but when I think about it I’ve only been in Japan for three months. That was when I realized it wasn’t\nt going to happen with the girl and the walks stopped. Someone might say that the first three months were Japan and the second three months were just normal life, and someone else might say that the second three months were Japan and the first three months were something entirely different. Having lived all six I can see both sides.\n\nYou have to understand that this story only makes sense if I was never in love. If I’m in love it makes a different kind of sense, but a crazy one, and you really would have to be warped to understand it much less live it. But if I’m not in love that means this isn’t a crazy story and that all I’ve done here is learn something very important and very true which might be even scarier than being crazy.\n\nI came to this beach town today to finish reading this book and to start writing a new chapter of my own, and I came here to swim. But the waves weren’t big enough to make it worth getting wet. So I left the beach and I walked to the cafe, and since I had been planning on swimming I wasn’t wearing any underwear, which with the shorts I was wearing made me feel very exposed, very outlined if you know what I’m saying. I don’t think anyone noticed, though. Which is interesting because I think if I were a girl I would notice.\n\nI notice a lot about girls who are strangers, especially the little things. I mean yes I notice how pretty their face is and I notice what they’re wearing and how big their breasts are and all of that stuff. But I also notice the precise tone of their voice, and how happy or sad they are based on the way they walk, and whether they seem to like little kids or hate them. The odd thing is that once I know a girl, or at least want to know her, I don’t notice any of that. I won’t notice if she got a haircut or if the clothes she’s wearing look particularly nice today. I’ll have already picked the things I want to notice, like how pretty the accent in her voice is when she says sorry, and I’ll notice those things no matter what. And of course I’ll spend the whole time trying to make her laugh.\n\nI think I’d better stop writing this. You’ve been patient enough with me, reading all this way. I just needed to find someone to talk to about the ending of *A Farewell to Arms*. After his wife and baby died the main character didn’t seem to have anything else left to write, and so he stopped, but I needed someone to keep going with. I guess I wanted to cry a little bit at just how lost he seemed to feel on the page after the last page where there was just empty space because he didn’t know how to finish.\n\nAnd when I looked up *A Farewell to Arms* online the first thing I read was some analysis about how early in the book when she slaps him she demonstrates agency against the patriarchy but later on because she says she would do whatever he wants since she’s in love with him she lost her agency. And that all made me feel a whole different kind of sad, because I think the author of *A Farewell to Arms* had big eyes just like me which people refused to see, or at least was an alcoholic. So I needed to write something down.\n\nOnce I finished the book and the cherry cake and the coffee there was a closed book and an empty plate and an empty mug sitting in front of me. They looked very nice just sitting there like that. I guess I wanted more but there wasn’t anything left. Soon I’ll be leaving Japan. It’s probably a good thing. I did everything I wanted to do here, or at least I tried, so I’ve got to be ready to go home. After all, I’ve been away for a very long time.\n\n\nPiece 2:\nIn Throes\n\nBefore I start the walk from my apartment to the park, I study my palms. There are all types of lines and marks and crossings there, running north and south and west, too. When I was a kid, I worried endlessly at the long, tapering streak which swelled just below my pinky, only to reach an undignified end just before my pointer finger. Back then, still ballooning into the world, I would caress each line, and wonder.\n\nAfter reviewing both palms, I return my left hand to my side and use the right to lock the door behind me. As I step out into the street, I realize it is past eleven. Music is playing from bars nearby, lit neon red signs and people spilling out from saloon doors into the street where they step around homeless sleepers and dodge hand-in-pocket passers-by.\n\nTurning right into a darker alley which leads to the park, I imagine I blend into the night. That I am just a silhouette, an invisible shade garbed in a black up-turned coat and chocolate brown skin who can melt into the void of the unlit facades.\n\nFor a long time I did not walk alone. We walked together—there used to be two of us, because there is supposed to be another—in the early mornings when people are with their dogs and smile at strangers. When I think back, I wonder if I knew what I was about to not have. I think the answer is yes. I always knew, have always known, to the bounds of my memory, even when I was a child. Now, a\napproaching a crosswalk, I see a group of girls walking in my direction. My chest tightens with anxiety. They are a swirl of pretty and blonde and dark and their short skirts swish in the cold nighttime air which caresses with searching fingers the warmth of all exposed skin. I empty my eyes. I can tell from the periphery of my vision that they are giggling, all of them giggling, a protective charm against tall dark men like me whose faces have no expression and who articulate from the open sewer drains and unmanaged refuse which litters the street.\n\nNear the park, the road slants upwards. I have been sitting since morning, so I can feel the joints in my hip groan as I begin to step over the sleeping figure spanning the sidewalk. He mumbles something in his sleep. It is a fact that people mumble in their sleep. My older brother did not mumble, so until about six months ago, I did not know the truth of it. She had a lot to say. My foot is still moving, almost in slow motion, over this spokesperson, this itinerant of the conscious and unconscious worlds.\n\nAcross the street a man is yelling. His arms are twitching, and I cannot make out his face. “Fuck you fuck I didn’t know slithering it come dog my god fuck shit it’s wow didn’t how know so soon why” he is saying. I am grateful my eyes are already empty and unfocused, uncompromisingly and undeniably absent from any sphere of interpersonality.\n\nBut then, just as my right foot touches the ground, the muscles below my waist freeze. I pause, unmoving. Beneath me, in between my legs, is a man mumbling under his breath. I consider now that we have become a mathematical equation, a Greek lambda stretched over a symbol of division.\n\nThe streetlamp directly above my head switches on. Around us the entire alleyway is unlit, the entire block, but beneath this lonely spotlight we two are bathed in a dome of illumination. Beyond the swirling blizzard of dust and powder exposed by the focused beam in the darkness, the streets around us fade to an invisible opacity. The screaming goes silent; we two are alone.\n\nThe muscles of my neck creak as they guide my head downwards. The man beneath me has been dressed in a pristine brown overcoat and stained corduroy pants. He has mismatched socks, both purple, and heavy boots with a thick sole. He is sleeping on a piece of cardboard with eyes wide open. He mumbles in his sleep.\n\nWhen I was nine years old I had a little white dog named Cookie. After a long walk I would set him next to me, pressed on the outside of my left leg, and open a book. I would feel his little belly swell and deflate against my thigh with each breath. In between turns of the page I would run my fingers through his white fur. When my parents would enter the house, a chaos of motion and sound, me and Cookie would continue there on the old, indented cushions of the couch. For a long time Cookie and I sat like that.\n\nI lean downwards, assuming a squatting position just out of contact with the man’s coat, my feet still stuck, motionless. His lips are moving relentlessly, the sound of escaping air magnetically attractive to my ear. I stretch my right palm out and set it against the cold pavement, transferring my weight from my legs to my arm. From there I slowly lower my body closer and closer to his mouth. My arm quivers, my elbow bends, my whole body shakes with exertion.\n\nJust before I meet his lips, I turn my head. I feel his breath, first as a vague intimation along my jawbone, then as a humid warmth which expands from my ear to the entirety of my right cheek. I listen to his words. I think about all the people, within this city and without, who are alone on this frigid summer night. I imagine being there with them, imagine the company I could provide. I start to swell, bigger and bigger, start to feel how much I am, how all-encompassing my presence is. The man’s eyes are yellower than his teeth but that is okay; I mumble too: “Everything is okay, now.”\n\nOn the bus sometimes a woman with frizzy hair and a meth-addled face twitches her way to the seat next to me. When the officer comes by to check our tickets he just shakes his head. There is a dome of light around us. I can hear your story.\n\nEventually, he finishes. I look back at him, and his lips settle to a final stillness, the edges curved slightly upwards, a homeostatic state of peace. As his eyes drift shut, I am overwhelmed with a sense of wholeness. The overhead streetlamp begins to dim, darker and darker, until the light goes out and the snowy, dusting deluge disappears into the ether from whence it was pulled. In one of the apartments above us, I can make out the gentle glow of string lights. Through an open window the sound of EDM plays, a thrumming, heavy beat laid over the creaking of a bed frame. The man across the street is still yelling, and I come unstuck, my foot completing the step.\n\nWhen I enter the park I look down at my watch and see that a long time has passed since I left my building. The\nbenches are occupied, so I crouch beneath a flowering tree and look upwards. There is a perceptual trick to the crisscrossing lines and branches, a sense of descending vision through the cracks. Stars grimace from underneath leaves falling towards the sky. I put in my earbuds and play our song.\n\nWhen she left me it did not feel bad, did not feel like anything at all. I knelt on the hardwood tiles by our bed, raised my head to the mattress, and forced my vision to fix onto the covers, absolutely unmoving, the way I imagine Zen monks can for days and days which unfold without end. After a time the blankets started to shift, started to pulse and breathe like ocean waves in the oncoming evening tide. And finally, I felt a tremendous fear, because anything was possible.\n\nAs I walk back from the park, I notice the glint of my watch as it projects a sharpened glare into the eyes of a sleeping figure on a nearby bench. I conceal my left hand in my pocket and continue walking. Before long I have returned to the alleyway, where across the street the man is still crying, yelling, releasing a low, long series of unintelligible phrases. “Four times he said five fuck she didn’t ooh that’s one more night four into fucker going” he streams.\n\nParked next to the sidewalk is an ambulance, and walking by I shield my eyes from the blinding reddish orange light it casts in all directions. The window above us shuts and the music muffles, then turns silent. There are paramedics’ voices and a body bag is zipped shut and I hide, melting into the silhouettes of the buildings. Before long, my shadow returns to my door.\n\nI stare down at my palms and see how much has passed. Inside my apartment the bed is made and I am unable to think of anything except how tired I am, deep in my stomach, like a skyscraper who suddenly finds three floors have gone missing from the middle, no choice but to fold in half. I collapse into my bed and reach my right arm out to the end of the covers, the rest of my body still. I wonder what stories I will tell tonight.	2024-12-20 04:39:39.194162	2024-12-20 04:39:39.194164	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Levinthal tutorial submission-6159", "chunks_count": 4}

There is no one around and nothing\nin sight except the sand. I, too, am naked, barefoot, dumbfounded\nby everything around me. I can feel the sand under my feet and a\ncool wind. I move slowly toward the bench. When and why has she\ncome back after all these years? Her long black hair is piled about\nher head. A few locks cover her right cheek, as if guarding her face,\nwhich has not changed with the years. Her eyebrows are carefully\nplucked, and her eyelids, which end in thick eyelashes, are shut.\nHer nose guards her lips, which bear pink lipstick as if she were still\nalive. Her nipples are erect; there is no trace of the surgery. Her\nhands are clasped over her navel; her fingernails and toenails are\npainted the same pink as her lipstick. Her pubic hair is shaved.\nI wonder whether she is asleep or dead. I am afraid to touch her. I\nlook into her face and whisper her name, “Reem.” She smiles, her\neyes still shut at first. Then she opens them, and the blackness in her\npupils smiles as well. I can't grasp what is going on. I ask in a loud\nvoice, “Reem, what are you doing here?"\nI am about to hug and kiss her, but she warns me: “Don't kiss me.\nWash me first so we can be together and then . . . ”\n"What? You are still alive?"\n“Wash me so we can be together. I missed you so much.”\n“But you are not dead!"\n“Wash me, darling . . . Wash me so we can be together.”\n“With what? There is nothing here."\n"Wash me, darling." Raindrops begin to fall, and she closes her eyes. I wipe a drop off\nher nose with my index finger. Her skin is warm, which means she is\nalive. I start to caress her hair. I will wash her with the rain, I think.\nShe smiles as if she'd heard my thought. Another drop settles above\nher left eyebrow. I wipe it off.\nI think I hear a car approaching. I turn around and see a Humvee\ndriving at an insane speed, leaving a trail of flying dust. It suddenly\nswerves to the right and comes to a stop a few meters away from us. Its\ndoors open. Masked men wearing khaki uniforms and carrying ma-\nchine guns rush toward us. I try to shield Reem with my right hand,\nbut one of the men has already reached me. He hits me in the face\nwith the stock of his machine gun. I fall to the ground. He kicks me in\nthe stomach. Another starts dragging me away from the washing\nbench. None of them says a word. I am screaming and cursing them,\nbut I can't hear myself. Two men force me to get down on my knees\nand tie my wrists with a wire behind my back. One of them puts a\nknife to my neck; the other blindfolds me. I try to run away, but they\nhold me tightly. I scream again, but cannot hear my screams. I hear\nonly Reem's shrieks, the laughter and grunts of the men, the sound of\nthe rain.\nI feel a sharp pain, then the cold blade of the knife penetrating\nmy neck. Hot blood spills over my chest and back. My head falls to\nthe ground and rolls like a ball on the sand. I hear footsteps. One of\nthe men takes off my blindfold and shoves it into his pocket. He spits\nin my face and goes away. I see my body to the left of the bench,\nkneeling in a puddle of blood.\nThe other men return to the Humvee, two of them dragging\nReem by her arms. She tries to turn her head back in my direction,\nbut one of them slaps her. I cry out her name but can't hear my\nvoice. They put her in the back seat and shut the door. The engine\nstarts. The Humvee speeds away and disappears over the horizon.\nThe rain keeps falling on the empty bench.\nI woke up panting and sweating. I wiped my forehead and face. The\nsame nightmare had been recurring for weeks, with minor changes. Sometimes I saw Reem's severed head on the bench and heard her\nvoice saying, "Wash me, darling,” but this was the first time there\nwas rain. It must have slipped into my dream from outdoors. I could\nhear drops on the window next to my bed.\nI looked at my watch. It was already 3:30 A.M.\nI've slept only three hours after a long and grueling day. I am\nworn out.\nDeath is not content with what it takes from me in my waking\nhours, it insists on haunting me even in my sleep. Isn't it enough\nthat I toil all day tending to its eternal guests, preparing them to\nsleep in its lap? Is death punishing me because I thought I could\nescape its clutches? If my father were still alive he would mock my\nsilly thoughts. He would dismiss all this as infantile, unbecoming to\na man. Didn't he spend a lifetime doing his job day after day, never\nonce complaining of death? But death back then was timid and\nmore measured than today.\nI can almost hear death saying: “I am what I am and haven't\nchanged at all. I am but a postman.”\nIf death is a postman, then I receive his letters every day. I am the\none who opens carefully the bloodied and torn envelopes. I am the\none who washes them, who removes the stamps of death and dries\nand perfumes them, mumbling what I don't entirely believe in.\nThen I wrap them carefully in white so they may reach their final\nreader-the grave.\nBut letters are piling up, Father! Tenfold more than what you used\nto see in the span of a week now pass before me in a day or two. If you\nwere alive, Father, would you say that that is fate and God's will? I\nwish you were here so I could leave Mother with you and escape\nwithout feeling guilty. You were heavily armed with faith, and that\nmade your heart a castle. My heart, by contrast, is an abandoned\nhouse whose windows are shattered and doors unhinged. Ghosts\nplay inside it, and the winds wail.\nAs a child, I would cover my head with a second pillow to block\nout noise. I look for it now; it has fallen by the bed next to my\nslippers. I pick it up and bury my head under it in order to reclaim my share of the night. The image of Reem being dragged away by\nher hair keeps returning.\nReem hadn't been at the heart of my nightmare until a few weeks\nago. Where was she now? I heard a few years ago that she was in\nAmsterdam. I'll Google her again tomorrow when I go to the Inter-\nnet café after work. I'll try a different spelling of her name in English\nand maybe I'll find something. But can I just grab a bit of sleep for\nan hour or two? I stood next to my mother on the steps in front of the big\nwooden door. Her right hand firmly clasped my right hand, as if I\nwere about to run or fly away. Her left hand carried the sufurtas in\nwhich she packed my father's lunch—three small copper pots, each\nstacked on top of the other in a metal skeleton resembling a little\nmetal building. The top pot was filled with rice. The middle one\nwith okra stew and two pieces of meat. The lower pot usually had\nsome fruit. That day she'd put in a tiny bunch of white grapes, the\nkind we call "goat nipples," that my father liked. There was a warm\nloaf of homemade bread in the nylon sack dangling from her left\nwrist. She put her left foot on the steps and temporarily released my\nhand to knock four times. Her strong knocks pushed the door open.\nShe pretended not to see the young man squatting a few steps away\nfrom the door with his back to the wall. He was wearing black. His\nhead was buried in his hands and he looked like he was wailing.\nSmoke rose from the cigarette in his left hand. That was the first\ntime I'd seen a grown man cry.\nI looked into my mother's coffee-colored eyes. In a hushed voice,\nI asked, "Why is this man crying?"\nShe put her index finger on her lips to shush me and whispered,\n“Don't be rude, Jawad!"\nI craned to the left, curious to see what was happening inside. It\nwas the first time my mother had taken me to my father's place of\nwork. He usually took the sufurtas with him in the morning, but that\nday he had forgotten to bring it along.\nThe narrow walkway led to a wide room with a high ceiling. Three or four men were standing at its entrance with their backs\nblocking the scene. Were they watching my father as he worked?\nThe street was quiet and although the walkway was long, I could\nhear the sound of water being spilled, with my father's voice mutter-\ning phrases I couldn't understand, except for the word "God."\nMy mother knocked at the open door with more force and deter-\nmination this time and then called out “Hammoudy.” None of the\nmen turned around. Then the one standing to the far left moved\naside and Hammoudy's face appeared. He limped to the door. Ham-\nmoudy, my father's assistant, looked older than his actual age. He\nhad black hair and eyelashes as thick as a paint brush. He wore blue\nshorts and a white T-shirt which was wet in many spots. After ex-\nchanging a quick hello, my mother gave him the sufurtas and the\nbread saying: "Here, Hammoudy, this is Abu Ammoury's lunch. He\nforgot to take it.”\nHe thanked her and rushed back inside after shutting the door.\nShe held my hand again and we started to make our way back\nhome. I turned back to look at the squatting man. His head was still\nin his hands. My mother shook me and said, “Mind where you're\ngoing. You're going to trip and fall."\nAt that age I didn't know much about my father's work. All I knew\nwas that he was a mghassilchi, a body-washer, but this word was\nobscure to me. I was afraid that day and asked my mother: “Does\nFather hurt people?"\n“No son, not at all. It's quite the opposite. Why do you ask?"\n"But wasn't that man there crying?"\n"Yes, but not because of your father. He's just sad."\n“Why is he sad? What are they doing inside?"\n"Your dad washes the bodies of the dead. It's a very honorable\nprofession and those who do it are rewarded by God."\n"Why does he wash them? Are they dirty?"\n“No, but they must be purified."\n"And where do the dead go after they die?"\n"To God. Your father tends to them before they are buried."\n“How can they go to God if they are buried?” “The soul rises to the sky, but the body remains in the earth it\ncame from. It is said that we are come from Adam and Adam is of\ndust."\n\nI looked up to the sky. There were five clouds huddled together\nand I wondered: Which one will carry the dead man's soul? Where\nwill it take it? The only time I ever saw my father cry was many years later\nwhen he heard that my brother Ameer, whom we called Ammoury,\nhad died. Ameer, who was five years my senior, was transformed\nfrom "Doctor” into “Martyr.” His framed black-and-white photo-\ngraph occupied the heart of the main wall in our living room and\neven a bigger part of my father's heart, which Ammoury had already\nmonopolized. Ameer, you see, was the ideal son who had always\nmade my father proud. He always excelled and was the top of his\nclass. At the national baccalaureate exams, his score was 95 percent,\nwhich enabled him to go to medical school to study to become a\nsurgeon.

If you are\ndoing the assignment with the class, you can find these files at /data of any non-head node machine.\nIf you are following along at home, you can download these files with the commands inside the README.md.\n2 Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer\nIn the first part of the assignment, we will train and implement a byte-level byte-pair encoding (BPE)\ntokenizer [Sennrich et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2019]. In particular, we will represent arbitrary (Unicode)\nstrings as a sequence of bytes and train our BPE tokenizer on this byte sequence. Later, we will use this\ntokenizer to encode text (a string) into tokens (a sequence of integers) for language modeling.\n2.1 The Unicode Standard\nUnicode is a text encoding standard that maps characters to integer code points. As of Unicode 15.1 (released\nin September 2023), the standard defines 149,813 characters across 161 scripts. For example, the character\n"s" has the code point 115 (typically notated as U+0073, where U+ is a conventional prefix and 0073 is 115 in\nhexadecimal), and the character“牛”has the code point 29275. In Python, you can use the ord() function\nto convert a single Unicode character into its integer representation. The chr() function converts an integer\nUnicode code point into a string with the corresponding character.\n>>> ord('牛')\n29275\n>>> chr (29275)\n'牛'\n2 Problem (unicode1): Understanding Unicode (1 point)\n(a) What Unicode character does chr(0) return?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(b) How does this character's string representation (__repr__()) differ from its printed representation?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(c) What happens when this character occurs in text? It may be helpful to play around with the\nfollowing in your Python interpreter and see if it matches your expectations:\n>>> chr(0)\n>>> print(chr(0))\n>>> "this is a test" + chr(0) + "string"\n>>> print("this is a test" + chr(0) + "string")\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n2.2 Unicode Encodings\nWhile the Unicode standard defines a mapping from characters to code points (integers), it's impractical to\ntrain tokenizers directly on Unicode codepoints, since the vocabulary would be prohibitively large (around\n150K items) and sparse (since many characters are quite rare). Instead, we'll use a Unicode encoding, which\nconverts a Unicode character into a sequence of bytes. The Unicode standard itself defines three encodings:\nUTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, with UTF-8 being the dominant encoding for the Internet (more than 98%\nof all webpages).\nTo encode a Unicode string into UTF-8, we can use the encode() function in Python. To access the\nunderlying byte values for a Python bytes object, we can iterate over it (e.g., call list()). Finally, we can\nuse the decode() function to decode a UTF-8 byte string into a Unicode string.\n>>> test_string = "hello! こんにちは!"\n>>> utf8_encoded = test_string.encode("utf-8")\n>>> print(utf8_encoded)\nb'hello! \\xe3\\x81\\x93\\xe3\\x82\\x93\\xe3\\x81\\xab\\xe3\\x81\\xa1\\xe3\\x81\\xaf!'\n>>> print (type(utf8_encoded))\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> # Get the byte values for the encoded string (integers from 0 to 255).\n>>> list (utf8_encoded)\n[104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33, 32, 227, 129, 147, 227, 130, 147, 227, 129, 171, 227, 129,\n161, 227, 129, 175, 33]\n>>> # One byte does not necessarily correspond to one Unicode character!\n>>> print(len(test_string))\n13\n>>> print (len(utf8_encoded))\n23\n>>> print (utf8_encoded.decode("utf-8"))\nhello! こんにちは!\nBy converting our Unicode codepoints into a sequence of bytes (e.g., via the UTF-8 encoding), we are\nessentially taking a sequence of codepoints (integers in the range 0 to 149,812) and transforming it into a\n3 sequence of byte values (integers in the range 0 to 255). The 256-length byte vocabulary is much more\nmanageable to deal with. When using byte-level tokenization, we do not need to worry about out-of-\nvocabulary tokens, since we know that any input text can be expressed as a sequence of integers from 0 to\n255.\nProblem (unicode2): Unicode Encodings (3 points)\n(a) What are some reasons to prefer training our tokenizer on UTF-8 encoded bytes, rather than\nUTF-16 or UTF-32? It may be helpful to compare the output of these encodings for various\ninput strings.\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\n(b) Consider the following (incorrect) function, which is intended to decode a UTF-8 byte string into\na Unicode string. Why is this function incorrect? Provide an example of an input byte string\nthat yields incorrect results.\ndef decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong (bytestring: bytes):\nreturn "".join([bytes([b]).decode("utf-8") for b in bytestring])\n>>> decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong("hello".encode("utf-8"))\n'hello'\nDeliverable: An example input byte string for which decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong pro-\nduces incorrect output, with a one-sentence explanation of why the function is incorrect.\n(c) Give a two byte sequence that does not decode to any Unicode character(s).\nDeliverable: An example, with a one-sentence explanation.\n2.3 Subword Tokenization\nWhile byte-level tokenization can alleviate the out-of-vocabulary issues faced by word-level tokenizers, to-\nkenizing text into bytes results in extremely long input sequences. This slows down model training, since\na sentence with 10 words might only be 10 tokens long in a word-level language model, but could be 50 or\nmore tokens long in a character-level model (depending on the length of the words). Processing these longer\nsequences requires more computation at each step of the model. Furthermore, language modeling on byte\nsequences is difficult because the longer input sequences create long-term dependencies in the data.\nSubword tokenization is a midpoint between word-level tokenizers and byte-level tokenizers. Note that a\nbyte-level tokenizer's vocabulary has 256 entries (byte values are 0 to 225). A subword tokenizer trades-off a\nlarger vocabulary size for better compression of the input byte sequence. For example, if the byte sequence\nb'the' often occurs in our raw text training data, assigning it an entry in the vocabulary would reduce this\n3-token sequence to a single token.\nHow do we select these subword units to add to our vocabulary? Sennrich et al. [2016] propose to use\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE; Gage, 1994), a compression algorithm that iteratively replaces (“merges”) the\nmost frequent pair of bytes with a single, new unused index. Note that this algorithm adds subword tokens\nto our vocabulary to maximize the compression of our input sequences if a word occurs in our input text\nenough times, it'll be represented as a single subword unit.\nSubword tokenizers with vocabularies constructed via BPE are often called BPE tokenizers. In this\nassignment, we'll implement a byte-level BPE tokenizer, where the vocabulary items are bytes or merged\nsequences of bytes, which give us the best of both worlds in terms of out-of-vocabulary handling and man-\nageable input sequence lengths. The process of constructing the BPE tokenizer vocabulary is known as\n"training" the BPE tokenizer.\n4 2.4 BPE Tokenizer Training\nThe BPE tokenizer training procedure consists of three main steps.\nVocabulary initialization. The tokenizer vocabulary is a one-to-one mapping from string token to integer\nID. Since we're training a byte-level BPE tokenizer, our initial vocabulary is simply the set of all bytes. Since\nthere are 256 possible byte values, our initial vocabulary is of size 256.\nPre-tokenization. Once you have a vocabulary, you could, in principle, count how often bytes occur next\nto each other in your text and begin merging them starting with the most frequent pair of bytes. However,\nthis is quite computationally expensive, since we'd have to go take a full pass over the corpus each time\nwe merge. In addition, directly merging bytes across the corpus may result in tokens that differ only in\npunctuation (e.g., dog! vs. dog.). These tokens would get completely different token IDs, even though they\nare likely to have high semantic similarity (since they differ only in punctuation).\nTo avoid this, we pre-tokenize the corpus. You can think of this as a coarse-grained tokenization over the\ncorpus that helps us count how often pairs of characters appear. For example, the word 'text' might be\na pre-token that appears 10 times. In this case, when we count how often the characters 't' and 'e' appear\nnext to each other, we will see that the word 'text' has 't' and 'e' adjacent and we can increment their count\nby 10 instead of looking through the corpus. Since we're training a byte-level BPE model, each pre-token is\nrepresented as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.\nThe original BPE implementation of Sennrich et al. [2016] pre-tokenizes by simply splitting on whitespace\n(i.e., s.split(" ")). In contrast, we'll use a regex-based pre-tokenizer (used by GPT-2; Radford et al., 2019)\nfrom github.com/openai/tiktoken/pull/234/files:\n>>> PAT = r"""'(?:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+"""\nIt may be useful to interactively split some text with this pre-tokenizer to get a better sense of its\nbehavior:\n>>> # requires `pip install regex\n>>> import regex as re\n>>> re.findall (PAT, "some text that i'll pre-tokenize")\n['some', 'text', ' that', ' i', "'ll", ' pre', '-', 'tokenize']\nCompute BPE merges. Now that we've converted our input text into pre-tokens and represented each\npre-token as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, we can compute the BPE merges (i.e., train the BPE tokenizer).\nAt a high level, the BPE algorithm iteratively counts every pair of bytes and identifies the pair with the\nhighest frequency (“A”, “B”). Every occurrence of this most frequent pair (“A”, “B”) is then merged, i.e.,\nreplaced with a new token "AB". This new merged token is added to our vocabulary; as a result, the final\nvocabulary after BPE training is the size of the initial vocabulary (256 in our case), plus the number of BPE\nmerge operations used for training. For efficiency during BPE training, we do not consider pairs that cross\npre-token boundaries.2 When computing merges, deterministically break ties in pair frequency by preferring\nthe lexicographically greater pair. For example, if the pairs ("A”, “B”), (“А”, “C”), (“B”, “ZZ”), and (“BA",\n"A") all have the highest frequency, we'd merge (“BA”, “A”):\n>>> max([("A", "B"), ("A", "C"), ("B", "ZZ"), ("BA", "A")])\n('BA', 'A')\n2Note that the original BPE formulation [Sennrich et al., 2016] specifies the inclusion of an end-of-word token. We do not\nadd an end-of-word-token when training byte-level BPE models because all bytes (including whitespace and punctuation) are\nincluded in the model's vocabulary. Since we're explicitly representing spaces and punctuation, the learned BPE merges will\nnaturally reflect these word boundaries.\n5 Special tokens. Often, some strings (e.g., <|endoftext|>) are used to encode metadata (e.g., boundaries\nbetween documents). When encoding text, it's often desirable to treat some strings as "special tokens" that\nshould never be split into multiple tokens (i.e., will always be preserved as a single token). For example,\nthe end-of-sequence string <|endoftext|> should always be preserved as a single token (i.e., a single integer\nID), so we know when to stop generating from the language model. These special tokens must be added to\nthe vocabulary, so they have a corresponding fixed token ID.\nAlgorithm 1 of Sennrich et al. [2016] contains a inefficient implementation of BPE tokenizer training\n(essentially following the steps that we outlined above). As a first exercise, it may be useful to implement\nand test this function to test your understanding.\nExample (bpe_example): BPE training example\nHere is a stylized example from Sennrich et al. [2016]. Consider a corpus consisting of the following text\nlow low low low low\nlower lower widest widest widest\nnewest newest newest newest newest newest\nand the vocabulary has a special token <|endoftext|>.\nVocabulary We initialize our vocabulary with our special token <|endoftext|> and the 256 byte\nvalues.\nPre-tokenization When we pretokenize and count, we end up with the frequency table.\n{low: 5, lower: 2, widest: 3, newest:6}\nIt is often convenient to represent this as a dict [tuple [byte]: int], e.g. {(1,0,w):5 ...}\nMerges We first look at every successive pair of bytes and sum the frequency of the words where they\nappear {10: 7, ow: 7, we: 8, er: 2, wi: 3, id: 3, de: 3, es: 9, st: 9, ne: 6, ew: 6}. The pair ('es')\nand ('st') are tied, so we take the lexicographically greater pair, ('st'). We would then merge the\npre-tokens so that we end up with {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,e,st):3, (n,e,w,e,st):6}.\nIn the second round, we see that (e, st) is the most common pair (with a count of 9) and we\nwould merge into {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,est):3, (n,e,w,est):6}. Continuing this, the\nsequence of merges we get in the end will be ['st', 'e st', 'o w', 'l ow', 'w est', 'n e',\n'ne west', 'w i', 'wi d', 'wid est', 'low e', 'lowe r'].\nIf we take 6 merges, we have ['s t', 'e st', 'o w', '1 ow', 'w est', 'n e' and our vocab-\nulary elements would be [<|endoftext|>, [...256 BYTE CHARS], st, est, ow, low, west, ne].\nWith this vocabulary and set of merges, the word newest would tokenize as [ne, west].\nThis naïve implementation of BPE training is slow because for every merge, it iterates over all byte pairs\nto identify the most frequent pair. However, the only pair counts that change after each merge are those\nthat overlap with the merged pair. Thus, BPE training speed can be improved by indexing the counts of\nall pairs and incrementally updating these counts, rather than explicitly iterating over each pair of bytes to\ncount pair frequencies.\nProblem (train_bpe): BPE Tokenizer Training (15 points)\nDeliverable: Write a function that, given path to an input text file, trains a (byte-level) BPE\ntokenizer. Your BPE training function should handle (at least) the following input parameters: input_path: str Path to a text file with BPE tokenizer training data.\nvocab_size: int A non-negative integer that defines the maximum final vocabulary size (including\nthe initial byte vocabulary, vocabulary items produced from merging, and any special tokens).\nspecial_tokens: list[str) A list of strings to add to the vocabulary. These special tokens do not\notherwise affect BPE training.\nYour BPE training function should return the resulting vocabulary and merges:\nvocab: dict[int, bytes] The tokenizer vocabulary, a mapping from int (token ID in the vocabu-\nlary) to bytes (token bytes).\nmerges: list [tuple [bytes, bytes]] A list of BPE merges produced from training. Each list\nitem is a tuple of bytes (<token1>, <token2>), representing that <token1> was merged with\n<token2>. The merges should be ordered by order of creation.\nTo test your BPE training function against our provided tests, you will first need to implement the\ntest adapter at [adapters.run_train_bpe]. Then, run pytest tests/test_train_bpe.py. Your\nimplementation should be able to pass all tests.\n2.5 Experimenting with BPE Tokenizer Training\nLet's train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset. Instructions to find / download the dataset\ncan be found in Section 1. Before you start, we recommend taking a look at the TinyStories dataset to get\na sense of what's in the data.\nProblem (train_bpe_tinystories): BPE Training on TinyStories (2 points)\n(a) Train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset, using a maximum vocabulary size\nof 10,000. Make sure to add the TinyStories <|endoftext |> special token to the vocabulary.\nSerialize the resulting vocabulary and merges to disk for further inspection. How many hours\nand memory did training take? What is the longest token in the vocabulary? Does it make sense?\nResource requirements: < 30 minutes (no GPUs), < 30GB RAM\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\n(b) Profile your code. What part of the tokenizer training process takes the most time?\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\nNext, we'll try training a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the OpenWebText dataset. As before, we recom-\nmend taking a look at the dataset to better understand its contents.\nProblem (train_bpe_expts_owt): BPE Training on OpenWebText (2 points)\n(a) Train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the OpenWebText dataset, using a maximum vocabulary\nsize of 32,000. Serialize the resulting vocabulary and merges to disk for further inspection. What\nis the longest token in the vocabulary? Does it make sense?\nResource requirements: < 12 hours (no GPUs), < 100GB RAM\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\n7 (b) Compare and contrast the tokenizer that you get training on TinyStories versus OpenWebText.\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\n2.6 ΒΡΕ Tokenizer: Encoding and Decoding\nIn the previous part of the assignment, we implemented a function to train a BPE tokenizer on input text\nto obtain a tokenizer vocabulary and a list of BPE merges. Now, we will implement a BPE tokenizer that\nloads a provided vocabulary and list of merges and uses them to encode and decode text to/from token IDs.\n2.6.1 Encoding text\nThe process of encoding text by BPE mirrors how we train the BPE vocabulary. There are a few major\nsteps.\nStep 1: Pre-tokenize. We first pre-tokenize the sequence and represent each pre-token as a sequence of\nUTF-8 bytes, just as we did in BPE training. We will be merging these bytes within each pre-token into\nvocabulary elements.\nStep 2: Apply the merges. We then take the sequence of vocabulary element merges created during BPE\ntraining, and apply it to our pre-tokens in the same order of creation.\nExample (bpe_encoding): BPE encoding example\nFor example, suppose our input string is 'the cat ate', our vocabulary is {0:\nb' ', 1: b'a',\nb'the', 10: b'\n(b'th', b'e'),\n2: b'c', 3: b'e', 4: b'h', 5: b't', 6: b'th', 7: b'c', 8: b'a', 9:\nat'}, and our learned merges are [(b't', b'h'), (' ', b'c'), (b' ', 'a'),\n(b' a', b't')]. First, our pre-tokenizer would split this string into ['the', 'cat', 'ate'].\nThen, we'll look at each pre-token and apply the BPE merges.\nThe first pre-token 'the' is initially represented as [b't', b'h', b'e']. Looking at our list of\nmerges, we identify the first applicable merge to be (b't', b'h'), and use that the transform the\npre-token into [b'th', b'e']. Then, we go back to the list of merges and identify the next applicable\nmerge to be (b'th', b'e'), which transforms the pre-token into [b'the']. Finally, looking back at\nthe list of merges, we see that there are no more that apply to the string (since the entire pre-token has\nbeen merged into a single token), so we are done applying the BPE merges. The corresponding integer\nsequence is [9].\nRepeating this process for the remaining pre-tokens, we see that the pre-token 'cat' is represented\nas [b'c', b'a', b't'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the integer sequence [7, 1,\n5]. The final pre-token 'ate' is [b' at', b'e'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the\ninteger sequence [10, 3]. Thus, the final result of encoding our input string is [9, 7, 1, 5, 10,\n3].\nSpecial tokens. Your tokenizer should be able to properly handle user-defined special tokens when en-\ncoding text (provided when constructing the tokenizer).\nMemory considerations. Suppose we want to tokenize a large text file that we cannot fit in memory.\nTo efficiently tokenize this large file (or any other stream of data), we need to break it up into manageable\nchunks and process each chunk in-turn, so that the memory complexity is constant as opposed to linear in\nthe size of the text. In doing so, we need to make sure that a token doesn't cross chunk boundaries, else\nwe'll get a different tokenization than the naïve method of tokenizing the entire sequence in-memory.\n8	2025-01-04 23:04:43.889748	2025-01-04 23:04:43.88975	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-cs336_spring2024_assignment1_basics-9159", "chunks_count": 10}

But on the concrete road Al built up his speed because the flattened springs were not in danger any more. From Sallisaw to Gore is twenty-one miles and the Hudson was doing thirty-five miles an hour. From Gore to Warner thirteen miles; Warner to Checotah fourteen miles; Checotah a long jump to Henrietta—thirty-four miles, but a real town at the end of it. Henrietta to Castle nineteen miles, and the sun was overhead, and the red fields, heated by the high sun, vibrated the air.\n\nAl, at the wheel, his face purposeful, his whole body listening to the car, his restless eyes jumping from the road to the instrument panel. Al was one with his engine, every nerve listening for weaknesses, for the thumps or squeals, hums and chattering that indicate a change that may cause a breakdown. He had become the soul of the car.\n\nGranma, beside him on the seat, half slept, and whimpered in her sleep, opened her eyes to peer ahead, and then dozed again. And Ma sat beside Granma, one elbow out the window, and the skin reddening under the fierce sun. Ma looked ahead too, but her eyes were flat and did not see the road or the fields, the gas stations, the little eating sheds. She did not glance at them as the Hudson went by.\n\nAl shifted himself on the broken seat and changed his grip on the steering wheel. And he sighed, “Makes a racket, but I think she’s awright. God knows what she’ll do if we got to climb a hill with the load we got. Got any hills ’tween here an’ California, Ma?”\n\nMa turned her head slowly and her eyes came to life. “Seems to me they’s hills,” she said. “’Course I dunno. But seems to me I heard they’s hills an’ even mountains. Big ones.”\n\nGranma drew a long whining sigh in her sleep.\n\nAl said, “We’ll burn right up if we got climbin’ to do. Have to throw out some a’ this stuff. Maybe we shouldn’ a brang that preacher.”\n\n“You’ll be glad a that preacher ’fore we’re through,” said Ma. “That preacher’ll help us.” She looked ahead at the gleaming road again.\n\nAl steered with one hand and put the other on the vibrating gear-shift lever. He had difficulty in speaking. His mouth formed the words silently before he said them aloud. “Ma—” She looked slowly around at him, her head swaying a little with the car’s motion. “Ma, you scared a goin’? You scared a goin’ to a new place?”\n\nHer eyes grew thoughtful and soft. “A little,” she said. “Only it ain’t like scared so much. I’m jus’ a settin’ here waitin’. When somepin happens that I got to do somepin— I’ll do it.”\n\n“Ain’t you thinkin’ what’s it gonna be like when we get there? Ain’t you scared it won’t be nice like we thought?”\n\n“No,” she said quickly. “No, I ain’t. You can’t do that. I can’t do that. It’s too much— livin’ too many lives. Up ahead they’s a thousand lives we might live, but when it comes, it’ll on’y be one. If I go ahead on all of ’em, it’s too much. You got to live ahead ’cause you’re so young, but— it’s jus’ the road goin’ by for me. An’ it’s jus’ how soon they gonna wanta eat some more pork bones.” Her face tightened. “That’s all I can do. I can’t do no more. All the rest’d get upset if I done any more’n that. They all depen’ on me jus’ thinkin’ about that.”\n\nGranma yawned shrilly and opened her eyes. She looked wildly about. “I got to get out, praise Gawd,” she said.\n\n“First clump a brush,” said Al. “They’s one up ahead.”\n\n“Brush or no brush, I got to git out, I tell ya.” And she began to whine, “I got to git out. I got to git out.”\n\nAl speeded up, and when he came to the low brush he pulled up short. Ma threw the door open and half pulled the struggling old lady out beside the road and into the bushes. And Ma held her so Granma would not fall when she squatted.\n\nOn top of the truck the others stirred to life. Their faces were shining with sunburn they could not escape. Tom and Casy and Noah and Uncle John let themselves wearily down. Ruthie and Winfield swarmed down the side-boards and went off into the bushes. Connie helped Rose of Sharon gently down. Under the canvas, Grampa was awake, his head sticking out, but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless. He watched the others, but there was little recognition in his watching.\n\nTom called to him, “Want to come down, Grampa?”\n\nThe old eyes turned listlessly to him. “No,” said Grampa. For a moment the fierceness came into his eyes. “I ain’t a-goin’, I tell you. Gonna stay like Muley.” And then he lost interest again. Ma came back, helping Granma up the bank to the highway.\n\n“Tom,” she said. “Get that pan a bones, under the canvas in back. We got to eat somepin.” Tom got the pan and passed it around, and the family stood by the roadside, gnawing the crisp particles from the pork bones.\n\n“Sure lucky we brang these along,” said Pa. “Git so stiff up there can’t hardly move. Where’s the water?”\n\n“Ain’t it up with you?” Ma asked. “I set out that gallon jug.”\n\nPa climbed the sides and looked under the canvas. “It ain’t here. We must a forgot it.”\n\nThirst set in instantly. Winfield moaned, “I wanta drink. I wanta drink.” The men licked their lips, suddenly conscious of their thirst. And a little panic started.\n\nAl felt the fear growing. “We’ll get water first service station we come to. We need some gas too.” The family swarmed up the truck sides; Ma helped Granma in and got in beside her. Al started the motor and they moved on.\n\nCastle to Paden twenty-five miles and the sun passed the zenith and started down. And the radiator cap began to jiggle up and down and steam started to whish out. Near Paden there was a shack beside the road and two gas pumps in front of it; and beside a fence, a water faucet and a hose. Al drove in and nosed the Hudson up to the hose. As they pulled in, a stout man, red of face and arms, got up from a chair behind the gas pumps and moved toward them. He wore brown corduroys, and suspenders and a polo shirt; and he had a cardboard sun helmet, painted silver, on his head. The sweat beaded on his nose and under his eyes and formed streams in the wrinkles of his neck. He strolled toward the truck, looking truculent and stern.\n\n“You folks aim to buy anything? Gasoline or stuff?” he asked.\n\nAl was out already, unscrewing the steaming radiator cap with the tips of his fingers, jerking his hand away to escape the spurt when the cap should come loose. “Need some gas, mister.”\n\n“Got any money?”\n\n“Sure. Think we’re beggin’?”\n\nThe truculence left the fat man’s face. “Well, that’s all right, folks. Help yourself to water.” And he hastened to explain. “Road is full a people, come in, use water, dirty up the toilet, an’ then, by God, they’ll steal stuff an’ don’t buy nothin’. Got no money to buy with. Come beggin’ a gallon gas to move on.”\n\nTom dropped angrily to the ground and moved toward the fat man. “We’re payin’ our way,” he said fiercely. “You got no call to give us a goin’-over. We ain’t asked you for nothin’.”\n\n“I ain’t,” the fat man said quickly. The sweat began to soak through his short-sleeved polo shirt. “Jus’ help yourself to water, and go use the toilet if you want.”\n\nWinfield had got the hose. He drank from the end and then turned the stream over his head and face, and emerged dripping, “It ain’t cool,” he said.\n\n“I don’ know what the country’s comin’ to,” the fat man continued. His complaint had shifted now and he was no longer talking to or about the Joads. “Fifty-sixty cars a folks go by ever’ day, folks all movin’ west with kids an’ househol’ stuff. Where they goin’? What they gonna do?”\n\n“Doin’ the same as us,” said Tom. “Goin’ someplace to live. Tryin’ to get along. That’s all.”\n\n“Well, I don’ know what the country’s comin’ to. I jus’ don’ know. Here’s me tryin’ to get along, too. Think any them big new cars stops here? No, sir! They go on to them yella-painted company stations in town. They don’t stop no place like this. Most folks stops here ain’t got nothin’.”\n\nAl flipped the radiator cap and it jumped into the air with a head of steam behind it, and a hollow bubbling sound came out of the radiator. On top of the truck, the suffering hound dog crawled timidly to the edge of the load and looked over, whimpering, toward the water. Uncle John climbed up and lifted him down by the scruff of the neck. For a moment the dog staggered on stiff legs, and then he went to lap the mud under the faucet. In the highway the cars whizzed by, glistening in the heat, and the hot wind of their going fanned into the service-station yard. Al filled the radiator with water.\n\n“I ain’t sayin’ that I’m tryin’ to git trade outa rich folks,” the fat man went on. “I’m jus’ tryin’ to git trade. Why, the folks that stops here begs gasoline an’ they trades for gasoline. I could show you in my back room the stuff they’ll trade for gas an’ oil: beds an’ baby buggies an’ pots an’ pans. One family traded a doll their kid had for a gallon. An’ what’m I gonna do with the stuff, open a junk shop? Why, one fella wanted to gimme his shoes for a gallon. An’ if I was that kinda fella I bet I could git—” He glanced at Ma and stopped.\n\nJim Casy had wet his head, and the drops still coursed down his high forehead, and his muscled neck was wet, and his shirt was wet. He moved over beside Tom. “It ain’t the people’s fault,” he said. “How’d you like to sell the bed you sleep on for a tankful a gas?”\n\n“I know it ain’t their fault. Ever’ person I talked to is on the move for a damn good reason. But what’s the country comin’ to? That’s what I wanta know. What’s it comin’ to? Fella can’t make a livin’ no more. Folks can’t make a livin’ farmin’. I ask you, what’s it comin’ to? I can’t figure her out. Ever’body I ask, they can’t figure her out. Fella wants to trade his shoes so he can git a hundred miles on. I can’t figure her out.” He took off his silver hat and wiped his forehead with his palm. And Tom took off his cap and wiped his forehead with it. He went to the hose and wet the cap through and squeezed it and put it on again. Ma worked a tin cup out through the side bars of the truck, and she took water to Granma and to Grampa on top of the load. She stood on the bars and handed the cup to Grampa, and he wet his lips, and then shook his head and refused more. The old eyes looked up at Ma in pain and bewilderment for a moment before the awareness receded again.\n\nAl started the motor and backed the truck to the gas pump. “Fill her up. She’ll take about seven,” said Al. “We’ll give her six so she don’t spill none.”\n\nThe fat man put the hose in the tank. “No, sir,” he said. “I jus’ don’t know what the country’s comin’ to. Relief an’ all.”\n\nCasy said, “I been walkin’ aroun’ in the country. Ever’body’s askin’ that. What we comin’ to? Seems to me we don’t never come to nothin’. Always on the way. Always goin’ and goin’. Why don’t folks think about that? They’s movement now. People moving. We know why, an’ we know how. Movin’ ’cause they got to. That’s why folks always move. Movin’ ’cause they want somepin better’n what they got. An’ that’s the on’y way they’ll ever git it, wantin’ it an’ needin’ it, they’ll go out an’ git it. It’s bein’ hurt that makes folks mad to fightin’. I been walkin’ aroun’ the country, an’ hearin’ folks talk like you.”\n\nThe fat man pumped the gasoline and the needle turned on the pump dial, recording the amount. “Yeah, but what’s it comin’ to? That’s what I want ta know.”\n\nTom broke in irritably, “Well, you ain’t never gonna know. Casy tries to tell ya an’ you jest ast the same thing over. I seen fellas like you before. You ain’t askin’ nothin’; you’re jus’ singin’ a kinda song. ‘What we comin’ to?’ You don’ wanta know. Country’s movin’ aroun’, goin’ places. They’s folks dyin’ all aroun’. Maybe you’ll die pretty soon, but you won’t know nothin’. I seen too many fellas like you. You don’t want to know nothin’. Just sing yourself to sleep with a song— ‘What we comin’ to?’” He looked at the gas pump, rusted and old, and at the shack behind it, built of old lumber, the nail holes of its first use still showing through the paint that had been brave, the brave yellow paint that had tried to imitate the big company stations in town. But the paint couldn’t cover the old nail holes and the old cracks in the lumber, and the paint could not be renewed. The imitation was a failure and the owner had known it was a failure. And inside the open door of the shack Tom saw the oil barrels, only two of them, and the candy counter with stale candies and licorice whips turning brown with age, and cigarettes. He saw the broken chair and the fly screen with a rusted hole in it. And the littered yard that should have been graveled, and behind, the corn field drying and dying in the sun. Beside the house the little stock of used tires and retreaded tires. And he saw for the first time the fat man’s cheap washed pants and his cheap polo shirt and his paper hat. He said, “I didn’ mean to sound off at ya, mister. It’s the heat. You ain’t got nothin’. Pretty soon you’ll be on the road yourse’f. And it ain’t tractors’ll put you there. It’s them pretty yella stations in town. Folks is movin’,” he said ashamedly. “An’ you’ll be movin’, mister.”\n\nThe fat man’s hand slowed on the pump and stopped while Tom spoke. He looked worriedly at Tom. “How’d you know?” he asked helplessly, “How’d you know we was already talkin’ about packin’ up an’ movin’ west?”\n\nCasy answered him. “It’s ever’body,” he said. “Here’s me that used to give all my fight against the devil ’cause I figgered the devil was the enemy. But they’s somethin’ worse’n the devil got hold a the country, an’ it ain’t gonna let go till it’s chopped loose. Ever see one a them Gila monsters take hold, mister? Grabs hold, an’ you chop him in two an’ his head hangs on. Chop him at the neck an’ his head hangs on. Got to take a screw-driver an’ pry his head apart to git him loose. An’ while he’s layin’ there, poison is drippin’ an’ drippin’ into the hole he’s made with his teeth.” He stopped and looked sideways at Tom.\n\nThe fat man stared hopelessly straight ahead. His hand started turning the crank slowly. “I dunno what we’re comin’ to,” he said softly.\n\nOver by the water hose, Connie and Rose of Sharon stood together, talking secretly. Connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup again. Rose of Sharon watched the cars go by on the highway. Connie held out the cup to her. “This water ain’t cool, but it’s wet,” he said.\n\nShe looked at him and smiled secretly. She was all secrets now she was pregnant, secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings. She was pleased with herself, and she complained about things that didn’t really matter. And she demanded services of Connie that were silly, and both of them knew they were silly. Connie was pleased with her too, and filled with wonder that she was pregnant. He liked to think he was in on the secrets she had. When she smiled slyly, he smiled slyly too, and they exchanged confidences in whispers. The world had drawn close around them, and they were in the center of it, or rather Rose of Sharon was in the center of it with Connie making a small orbit about her. Everything they said was a kind of secret.\n\nShe drew her eyes from the highway. “I ain’t very thirsty,” she said daintily. “But maybe I ought to drink.”\n\nAnd he nodded, for he knew well what she meant. She took the cup and rinsed her mouth and spat and then drank the cupful of tepid water. “Want another?” he asked.\n\n“Jus’ a half.” And so he filled the cup just half, and gave it to her. A Lincoln Zephyr, silvery and low, whisked by. She turned to see where the others were and saw them clustered about the truck. Reassured, she said, “How’d you like to be goin’ along in that?”\n\nConnie sighed, “Maybe—after.” They both knew what he meant. “An’ if they’s plenty work in California, we’ll git our own car. But them”—he indicated the disappearing Zephyr—“them kind costs as much as a good size house. I’d ruther have the house.”\n\n“I’d like to have the house an’ one a them,” she said. “But ’course the house would be first because—” And they both knew what she meant. They were terribly excited about the pregnancy.\n\n“You feel awright?” he asked.\n\n“Tar’d. Jus’ tar’d ridin’ in the sun.”\n\n“We got to do that or we won’t never get to California.”\n\n“I know,” she said.\n\nThe dog wandered, sniffing, past the truck, trotted to the puddle under the hose again and lapped at the muddy water. And then he moved away, nose down and ears hanging. He sniffed his way among the dusty weeds beside the road, to the edge of the pavement. He raised his head and looked across, and then started over. Rose of Sharon screamed shrilly. A big swift car whisked near; tires squealed. The dog dodged helplessly, and with a shriek, cut off in the middle, went under the wheels. The big car slowed for a moment and faces looked back, and then it gathered greater speed and disappeared. And the dog, a blot of blood and tangled, burst intestines, kicked slowly in the road.\n\nRose of Sharon’s eyes were wide. “D’you think it’ll hurt?” she begged. “Think it’ll hurt?”\n\nConnie put his arm around her. “Come set down,” he said. “It wasn’t nothin’.”\n\n“But I felt it hurt. I felt it kinda jar when I yelled.”\n\n“Come set down. It wasn’t nothin’. It won’t hurt.” He led her to the side of the truck away from the dying dog and sat her down on the running board.\n\nTom and Uncle John walked out to the mess. The last quiver was going out of the crushed body. Tom took it by the legs and dragged it to the side of the road. Uncle John looked embarrassed, as though it were his fault. “I ought ta tied him up,” he said.\n\nPa looked down at the dog for a moment and then he turned away. “Le’s get outa here,” he said. “I don’t know how we was gonna feed ’im anyways. Just as well, maybe.”\n\nThe fat man came from behind the truck. “I’m sorry, folks,” he said. “A dog jus’ don’ last no time near a highway. I had three dogs run over in a year. Don’t keep none, no more.” And he said, “Don’t you folks worry none about it. I’ll take care of ’im. Bury ’im out in the corn field.”\n\nMa walked over to Rose of Sharon, where she sat, still shuddering, on the running board. “You all right, Rosasharn?” she asked. “You feelin’ poorly?”\n\n“I seen that. Give me a start.”\n\n“I heard ya yip,” said Ma. “Git yourself laced up, now.”\n\n“You suppose it might of hurt?”\n\n“No,” said Ma. “’F you go to greasin’ yourself an’ feelin’ sorry, an’ tuckin’ yourself in a swalla’s nest, it might. Rise up now, an’ he’p me get Granma comfortable. Forget that baby for a minute. He’ll take care a hisself.”\n\n“Where is Granma?” Rose of Sharon asked.\n\n“I dunno. She’s aroun’ here somewheres. Maybe in the outhouse.”\n\nThe girl went toward the toilet, and in a moment she came out, helping Granma along. “She went to sleep in there,” said Rose of Sharon.\n\nGranma grinned. “It’s nice in there,” she said. “They got a patent toilet in there an’ the water comes down. I like it in there,” she said contentedly. “Would of took a good nap if I wasn’t woke up.”\n\n“It ain’t a nice place to sleep,” said Rose of Sharon, and she helped Granma into the car. Granma settled herself happily. “Maybe it ain’t nice for purty, but it’s nice for nice,” she said.\n\nTom said, “Le’s go. We got to make miles.”\n\nPa whistled shrilly. “Now where’d them kids go?” He whistled again, putting his fingers in his mouth.\n\nIn a moment they broke from the corn field, Ruthie ahead and Winfield trailing her. “Eggs!” Ruthie cried. “I got soft eggs.” She rushed close, with Winfield close behind. “Look!” A dozen soft, grayish-white eggs were in her grubby hand. And as she held up her hand, her eyes fell upon the dead dog beside the road. “Oh!” she said. Ruthie and Winfield walked slowly toward the dog. They inspected him.\n\nPa called to them, “Come on, you, ’less you want to git left.”\n\nThey turned solemnly and walked to the truck. Ruthie looked once more at the gray reptile eggs in her hand, and then she threw them away. They climbed up the side of the track. “His eyes was still open,” said Ruthie in a hushed tone.\n\nBut Winfield gloried in the scene. He said boldly, “His guts was just strowed all over—all over”—he was silent for a moment—“strowed—all—over,” he said, and then he rolled over quickly and vomited down the side of the track. When he sat up again his eyes were watery and his nose running. “It ain’t like killin’ pigs,” he said in explanation.\n\nAl had the hood of the Hudson up, and he checked the oil level. He brought a gallon can from the floor of the front seat and poured a quantity of cheap black oil into the pipes and checked the level again.\n\nTom came beside him. “Want I should take her a piece?” he asked.\n\n“I ain’t tired,” said Al.\n\n“Well, you didn’ get no sleep las’ night. I took a snooze this morning. Get up there on top. I’ll take her.”\n\n“Awright,” Al said reluctantly. “But watch the oil gauge pretty close. Take her slow. An’ I been watchin’ for a short. Take a look a the needle now an’ then. ’F she jumps to, discharge it’s a short. An’ take her slow, Tom. She’s overloaded.”\n\nTom laughed. “I’ll watch her,” he said. “You can rest easy.”\n\nThe family piled on top of the truck again. Ma settled herself beside Granma in the seat, and Tom took his place and started the motor. “Sure is loose,” he said, and he put it in gear and pulled away down the highway.\n\nThe motor droned along steadily and the sun receded down the sky in front of them. Granma slept steadily, and even Ma dropped her head forward and dozed. Tom pulled his cap over his eyes to shut out the blinding sun.\n\nPaden to Meeker is thirteen miles; Meeker to Harrah is fourteen miles; and then Oklahoma City—the big city. Tom drove straight on. Ma waked up and looked at the streets as they went through the city. And the family, on top of the truck, stared about at the stores, at the big houses, at the office buildings. And then the buildings grew smaller and the stores smaller. The wrecking yards and hot-dog stands, the out-city dance halls.\n\nRuthie and Winfield saw it all, and it embarrassed them with its bigness and its strangeness, and it frightened them with the fine-clothed people they saw. They did not speak of it to each other. Later—they would, but not now. They saw the oil derricks in the town, on the edge of the town; oil derricks black, and the smell of oil and gas in the air. But they didn’t exclaim. It was so big and so strange it frightened them.\n\nIn the street Rose of Sharon saw a man in a light suit. He wore white shoes and a flat straw hat. She touched Connie and indicated the man with her eyes, and then Connie and Rose of Sharon giggled softly to themselves, and the giggles got the best of them. They covered their mouths. And it felt so good that they looked for other people to giggle at. Ruthie and Winfield saw them giggling and it looked such fun that they tried to do it too—but they couldn’t. The giggles wouldn’t come. But Connie and Rose of Sharon were breathless and red with stifling laughter before they could stop. It got so bad that they had only to look at each other to start over again.\n\nThe outskirts were wide spread. Tom drove slowly and carefully in the traffic, and then they were on 66—the great western road, and the sun was sinking on the line of the road. The windshield was bright with dust. Tom pulled his cap lower over his eyes, so low that he had to tilt his head back to see out at all. Granma slept on, the sun on her closed eyelids, and the veins on her temples were blue, and the little bright veins on her cheeks were wine-colored, and the old brown marks on her face turned darker.\n\nTom said, “We stay on this road right straight through.”\n\nMa had been silent for a long time. “Maybe we better fin’ a place to stop ’fore sunset,” she said. “I got to get some pork a-boilin’ an’ some bread made. That takes time.”\n\n“Sure,” Tom agreed. “We ain’t gonna make this trip in one jump. Might’s well stretch ourselves.”\n\nOklahoma City to Bethany is fourteen miles.\n\nTom said, “I think we better stop ’fore the sun goes down. Al got to build that thing on the top. Sun’ll kill the folks up there.”\n\nMa had been dozing again. Her head jerked upright. “Got to get some supper a-cookin’,” she said. And she said, “Tom, your pa tol’ me about you crossin’ the State line—”\n\nHe was a long time answering. “Yeah? What about it, Ma?”\n\n“Well, I’m scairt about it. It’ll make you kinda runnin’ away. Maybe they’ll catch ya.”\n\nTom held his hand over his eyes to protect himself from the lowering sun. “Don’t you worry,” he said. “I figgered her out. They’s lots a fellas out on parole an’ they’s more goin’ in all the time. If I get caught for anything else out west, well, then they got my pitcher an’ my prints in Washington. They’ll sen’ me back. But if I don’t do no crimes, they won’t give a damn.”\n\n“Well, I’m a-scairt about it. Sometimes you do a crime, an’ you don’t even know it’s bad. Maybe they got crimes in California we don’t even know about. Maybe you gonna do somepin an’ it’s all right, an’ in California it ain’t all right.”\n\n“Be jus’ the same if I wasn’t on parole,” he said. “On’y if I get caught I get a bigger jolt’n other folks. Now you quit a-worryin’,” he said. “We got plenty to worry about ’thout you figgerin’ out things to worry about.”\n\n“I can’t he’p it,” she said. “Minute you cross the line you done a crime.”\n\n“Well, tha’s better’n stickin’ aroun’ Sallisaw an’ starvin’ to death,” he said. “We better look out for a place to stop.”\n\nThey went through Bethany and out on the other side. In a ditch, where a culvert went under the road, an old touring car was pulled off the highway and a little tent was pitched beside it, and smoke came out of a stove pipe through the tent. Tom pointed ahead. “There’s some folks campin’. Looks like as good a place as we seen.” He slowed his motor and pulled to a stop beside the road. The hood of the old touring car was up, and a middle-aged man stood looking down at the motor. He wore a cheap straw sombrero, a blue shirt, and a black, spotted vest, and his jeans were stiff and shiny with dirt. His face was lean, the deep cheek-lines great furrows down his face so that his cheek bones and chin stood out sharply. He looked up at the Joad truck and his eyes were puzzled and angry.\n\nTom leaned out of the window. “Any law ’gainst folks stoppin’ here for the night?”\n\nThe man had seen only the truck. His eyes focused down on Tom. “I dunno,” he said. “We on’y stopped here ’cause we couldn’t git no further.”\n\n“Any water here?”\n\nThe man pointed to a service-station shack about a quarter of a mile ahead. “They’s water there they’ll let ya take a bucket of.”\n\nTom hesitated. “Well, ya ’spose we could camp down alongside?”\n\nThe lean man looked puzzled. “We don’t own it,” he said. “We on’y stopped here ’cause this goddamn ol’ trap wouldn’ go no further.”\n\nTom insisted. “Anyways you’re here an’ we ain’t. You got a right to say if you wan’ neighbors or not.”\n\nThe appeal to hospitality had an instant effect. The lean face broke into a smile. “Why, sure, come on off the road. Proud to have ya.” And he called, “Sairy, there’s some folks goin’ ta stay with us. Come on out an’ say how d’ya do.” “Sairy ain’t well,” he added. The tent flaps opened and a wizened woman came out—a face wrinkled as a dried leaf and eyes that seemed to flame in her face, black eyes that seemed to look out of a well of horror. She was small and shuddering. She held herself upright by a tent flap, and the hand holding onto the canvas was a skeleton covered with wrinkled skin.\n\nWhen she spoke her voice had a beautiful low timbre, soft and modulated, and yet with ringing overtones. “Tell ’em welcome,” she said. “Tell ’em good an’ welcome.”\n\nTom drove off the road and brought his truck into the field and lined it up with the touring car. And people boiled down from the truck; Ruthie and Winfield too quickly, so that their legs gave way and they shrieked at the pins and needles that ran through their limbs. Ma went quickly to work. She untied the three-gallon bucket from the back of the truck and approached the squealing children. “Now you go git water—right down there. Ask nice. Say, ‘Please, kin we git a bucket a water?’ and say, ‘Thank you,’ An’ carry it back together helpin’, an’ don’t spill none. An’ if you see stick wood to burn, bring it on.” The children stamped away toward the shack.\n\nBy the tent a little embarrassment had set in, and social intercourse had paused before it started. Pa said, “You ain’t Oklahomy folks?”\n\nAnd Al, who stood near the car, looked at the license plates. “Kansas,” he said.\n\nThe lean man said, “Galena, or right about there. Wilson, Ivy Wilson.”\n\n“We’re Joads,” said Pa. “We come from right near Sallisaw.”\n\n“Well, we’re proud to meet you folks,” said Ivy Wilson. “Sairy, these is Joads.”\n\n“I knowed you wasn’t Oklahomy folks. You talk queer kinda—that ain’t no blame, you understand.”\n\n“Ever’body says words different,” said Ivy. “Arkansas folks says ’em different, and Oklahomy folks says ’em different. And we seen a lady from Massachusetts, an’ she said ’em differentest of all. Couldn’ hardly make out what she was sayin’.”\n\nNoah and Uncle John and the preacher began to unload the truck. They helped Grampa down and sat him on the ground and he sat limply, staring ahead of him. “You sick, Grampa?” Noah asked.\n\n“You goddamn right,” said Grampa weakly. “Sicker’n hell.”\n\nSairy Wilson walked slowly and carefully toward him. “How’d you like ta come in our tent?” she asked. “You kin lay down on our mattress an’ rest.”\n\nHe looked up at her, drawn by her soft voice. “Come on now,” she said. “You’ll git some rest. We’ll he’p you over.”\n\nWithout warning Grampa began to cry. His chin wavered and his old lips tightened over his mouth and he sobbed hoarsely. Ma rushed over to him and put her arms around him. She lifted him to his feet, her broad back straining, and she half lifted, half helped him into the tent.\n\nUncle John said, “He must be good an’ sick. He ain’t never done that before. Never seen him blubberin’ in my life.” He jumped up on the truck and tossed a mattress down.\n\nMa came out of the tent and went to Casy. “You been aroun’ sick people,” she said. “Grampa’s sick. Won’t you go take a look at him?”\n\nCasy walked quickly to the tent and went inside. A double mattress was on the ground, the blankets spread neatly; and a little tin stove stood on iron legs, and the fire in it burned unevenly. A bucket of water, a wooden box of supplies, and a box for a table, that was all. The light of the setting sun came pinkly through the tent walls. Sairy Wilson knelt on the ground, beside the mattress, and Grampa lay on his back. His eyes were open, staring upward, and his cheeks were flushed. He breathed heavily.\n\nCasy took the skinny old wrist in his fingers. “Feeling kinda tired, Grampa?” he asked. The staring eyes moved toward his voice but did not find him. The lips practiced a speech but did not speak it. Casy felt the pulse and he dropped the wrist and put his hand on Grampa’s forehead.

Life expectancy was highest\nfor women with income in the top 1% (86.4 years [95% CI, 85.7-87.1]) which\nwas 8.4 years (95% CI, 7.2-9.6) longer than women with income in the lowest 1%.\nMen with the lowest 1% income had the lowest life expectancy (70.6 years [95% CI,\n69.6-71.6]), which was 13.8 years (95% CI, 12.3-15.2) less than men with the\ntop 1% income. From 2005 to 2015, the differences in life expectancy by income\nincreased, largely attributable to deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancers,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia in older age groups and\nsubstance use deaths and suicides in younger age groups. Over the same period, life\nexpectancy for women in the highest income quartile increased 3.2 years (95% CI,\n2.7-3.7), while life expectancy for women in the lowest income quartile decreased\n0.4 years (95% CI, -1.0 to 0.2). For men, life expectancy increased 3.1 years (95% CI,\n2.5-3.7) in the highest income quartile and 0.9 years (95% CI, 0.2-1.6) in the lowest income\nquartile. Differences in life expectancy by income levels in Norway were similar to\ndifferences observed in the United States, except that life expectancy was higher\nin Norway in the lower to middle part of the income distribution in both men and women.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In Norway, there were substantial and increasing gaps\nin life expectancy by income level from 2005 to 2015. The largest differences in\nlife expectancy between Norway and United States were for individuals in the lower\nto middle part of the income distribution.\nEditorial page 1877\nSupplemental content\n+ CME Quiz at\njamanetwork.com/learning\nJAMA. 2019;321(19):1916-1925. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.4329\nPublished online May 13, 2019.\n2019 American Medical Association.

In 2014, the\ntop 1% of income earners received 8% of the total income in\nNorway. In comparison, the top 1% in the United States re-\nceived 20% of the total income. Among the 35 countries in\nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-\nment, the United States was ranked 4th and Norway was ranked\n31st in terms of income inequality measured by the Gini index\nin 2015.9,10 Despite this ranking, there are pronounced in-\nequalities in health in Norway regarding income, education,\nand occupation similar to inequalities observed in other high-\nincome countries.2\nThe 4 aims of this study were to (1) estimate differences\nin life expectancy at the age of 40 years by income, (2) exam-\nine time trends in life expectancy by income, (3) assess the\nincome-related gaps in life expectancy into causes of death\nby age groups, and (4) compare Norwegian estimates with US\nestimates reported by Chetty et al.¹\nMethods\nThe study was based on deidentified data from 4 Norwegian\nnational registries. The study was approved and participant\nconsent was waived by the Regional Committee for Medical\nand Health Research Ethics South-East Norway, reference num-\nber 2013/2394.\nData Sources and Study Population\nLinked individual-level information from the Population\nRegister, the National Registry for Personal Taxpayers, the\nCause of Death Registry, and the National Education Data-\nbase was used. The study contained information on income\nand population for more than 99% of the official Norwegian\npopulation.11 Because household income for children and\nyoung adults does not reflect adult lifetime income, 12 only\nthe population aged 40 years and older from 2005 to 2015\nwas included. The population with the lowest 3% of in-\ncome was excluded, which included individuals who had\nnegative or zero income, income from unregistered sources,\nor persons in other households who catered their expenses.\nSome immigrants return to their country of origin prior to\ndeath without notifying the Population Register13,14 and\nmore than 70% of individuals with missing household\nincome have been found to have immigrant background.15\nKey Points\nQuestion In Norway, a country with a largely tax-financed\nuniversal health care system and moderate income differences,\ndoes life expectancy vary with income, and are differences\ncomparable to differences in the United States?\nFindings In this registry-based study that included data from\n3 041 828 persons aged at least 40 years in Norway between\n2005 and 2015, the difference in life expectancy between the\nrichest and poorest 1% was 8.4 years for women and 13.8 years for\nmen. The differences widened between 2005 and 2015 and were\ncomparable to those in the United States.\nMeaning Inequalities in life expectancy by income in Norway\nwere substantial and increased between 2005 and 2015.\nHence, individuals not born in Norway or whose parents\nwere not born in Norway were excluded from the primary\nstudy population.\nIncome Measures\n"Household income" included income from wages, self-\nemployment, capital income, pensions, and social benefits.\nThe primary income measure was “equivalized household\nincome," defined as household income after tax divided by\nthe square root of the number of household members, 16 aver-\naged across the 5 preceding years (eMethods part I in the\nSupplement). Sensitivity analyses of individuals aged 63\nyears or older (eMethods part III and eFigure 2 in the Supple-\nment) and with alterations of the year of income measure-\nment (eMethods part III and eFigure 3 in the Supplement)\nwere performed.\nIndividuals were assigned percentile ranks from 1 to 100\nbased on equivalized household income relative to all other\nindividuals of the same sex and age each calendar year. For\nsome analyses, income was dichotomized into above and be-\nlow the median income or categorized into quartiles.\nCauses of Death\nYear and underlying cause of death were obtained from\nthe Cause of Death Registry, which contains 98.5% of all\ndeaths in Norway from 2005 to 2015.17 Underlying cause of\ndeath was classified using the International Classification of\nDiseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Country comparisons\nfrom the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that\n83.7% of deaths in Norway from 2005 to 2015 were well-\ncertified deaths. 18 Misclassification has been found to be\nreduced when causes of death were categorized by ICD\nchapter levels instead of using more detailed ICD-10 classifi-\ncation levels. 19 Causes of death were stratified into 12 sub-\ngroups based on the ICD-10 chapters and the European\nshortlist of causes of death (eTable 1 in the Supplement).\nStatistical Methods\nExpected age at death was calculated as life expectancy at 40\nyears of age plus 40 years. Death rates were calculated for 1-year\nage groups by sex and income percentiles. 20 The person-\nyears lived between ages x years and x plus 1 year for persons\njama.com\nJAMA May 21, 2019 Volume 321, Number 19\n1917\n2019 American Medical Association.

Panel A shows life expectancy by income percentile with\n95% Cls and panels B and C show life expectancy by income percentiles by\nhighest and lowest level of education. Estimated life expectancy was based on\ndying in this interval was set to 0.5. For individuals older than\n95 years, the mortality rate was set as constant and equal to\nthe crude rate. Chiang's method was used to calculate 95% CIs\nfor life expectancy. 21 The absolute life expectancy gaps by in-\ncome quartiles were decomposed by age and causes of death\nusing Arriaga's method. 22-24 To assess the contribution of smok-\ning to absolute life expectancy gaps by income quartiles, age-,\nsex-, and cause-specific life expectancy differences from\nArriaga's decomposition were multiplied by age-, sex-, and\ncause of death-specific population attributable fractions (PAF)\nfor smoking from the Global Burden of Disease Risk Factor\nStudy (estimates for Norway from 2011-2015).25\nMortality rate ratios (MRRs) by income were estimated\nby regressing the total number of deaths in 2015 (for each\nage, sex, and income combination) on a dichotomous vari-\nable for income (above or below median), adjusted for age\n(cubic-restricted age splines with 5 knots) and using log-\ntransformed total person-years as the offset, with a negative\nbinomial count model.26\nWhen analyzing time trends, life expectancy and mortal-\nity rates by income percentiles were calculated by year each\nyear from 2005 through 2015. All other analyses, except for\nanalyses used for the US comparisons, were based on com-\nbined data for the period of 2011 to 2015 to reflect the more\nrecent period.\nComparison Between Norway and the United States\nFor comparisons with the United States, a study population\nin accordance with the study by Chetty et al¹ was used.\nThis population included all residents (including individuals\nwith an immigrant background) for the years 2001 to 2014.\nInclusion/exclusion of immigrants from this part of the analy-\nses did not alter the interpretations.

Indi-\nviduals with the lowest percentiles of income were also\nexcluded because they consisted of individuals with negative\nincome or who may have had unregistered income. Because\nChetty et al did not adjust their income measure for family\nsize, this was also not done in the current study when gener-\nating the Norwegian life expectancy estimates by income for\ncomparison with the United States (eMethods part II in the\nSupplement).\nTo replicate the findings of Chetty et al,¹ mortality rates\nin predetermined age groups were estimated using the fol-\nlowing 4 steps: (1) for individuals aged 40 to 62 years, mor-\ntality rates were calculated with income from 1 to 5 years\nearlier, (2) income for individuals aged 63 to 76 years was\nmeasured at the ages of 58 to 62 years, (3) mortality rates\nfor individuals aged 77 to 90 years were extrapolated using\na Gompertz function fitted to the mortality rates between\nages 40 and 76 years, and (4) all individuals aged at least\n91 years were assigned sex-specific, income-independent\nmortality rates based on life tables published by Statis-\ntics Norway.11\nDescriptions of additional analyses performed to\naddress the consequences of including immigrants and per-\nsons with zero pensionable income in the study population,\nusing different methods of lagging income for individuals\naged 63 years or older, and using different number of lags\nfor the income variable appear in part II and part III in the\neMethods in the Supplement.\nThe analyses were conducted using Stata, version 15.1,\nMP-Parallel Edition (StataCorp).\nResults\nThe primary study population consisted of 3041828 per-\nsons aged at least 40 years, who contributed 25 805 277\n1918\nJAMA May 21, 2019 Volume 321, Number 19\n2019 American Medical Association.

For the years 2011 to 2015, men with in-\ncome in the bottom 1% had a life expectancy of 70.6 years (95%\nCI, 69.6-71.6), while men in the top 1% had a life expectancy\nof 84.4 years (95% CI, 83.4-85.4 years), a difference of 13.8 years\n(95% CI, 12.3-15.2) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Women in the\nbottom 1% had a life expectancy of 78.0 years (95% CI, 77.1-\n78.9) and women in the top 1% had a life expectancy of 86.4\nyears (95% CI, 85.7-87.1), a difference of 8.4 years (95% CI, 7.2-\n9.6) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).\nOf individuals with income in the lowest 1%, 50.6% (95%\nCI, 50.4%-50.8%) lived in single-person households (Figure 2),\nwhile only 9% (95% CI, 8.9%-9.1%) of individuals in the top\n1% of income were single-person households. Of individuals\nin the bottom 1% of income, 18.2% (95% CI, 18.0%-18.4%) had\na university education, and of individuals in the top 1% of in-\ncome, 53.9% (95% CI, 53.6%-54.1%) had a university educa-\ntion. Life expectancy was higher for individuals with higher\neducation in all levels of income (Figure 1B and C), and the\nshape of the curves showing life expectancy by income were\nsimilar when stratifying by level of education.\nContributions From Age and Causes of Death\nto the Income-Related Differences in Life Expectancy\nFor men, the gap in life expectancy between the top and bot-\ntom income quartiles was 8.0 years (95% CI, 7.4-8.6), and 2.4\nyears of this difference was found in individuals aged 60 to 69\nyears (Figure 3). For women, the total gap in life expectancy\nwas 6.0 years (95% CI, 5.5-6.5) between the top and bottom\nincome quartiles, and about 1.6 years of this difference was\nfound in individuals aged 60 to 69 years.\nDeaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributed\nmost to the gap in life expectancy, followed by cancers (including\nFigure 3.

In individuals aged 40 to 49 years, deaths from\nsubstance use disorders and suicide contributed more than CVD\nand cancer to the income-related gaps in life expectancy. Ap-\nplying smoking population-attributable fractions to life expec-\ntancy differences suggested that smoking explained 1.7 years\nof the 8-year difference in life expectancy between lower and\nupper income quartiles in men and 1.2 years of the 6-year dif-\nference in women.\nThe MRRs compared cause-specific mortality rates in\nindividuals whose income was below the median value with\nindividuals whose income was above the median value\n(Table). Men and women with income below the median\nincome had significantly higher mortality rates for all\ncauses of death. The most pronounced difference was\nfound in deaths from substance use disorders, with an MRR\nof 4.1 (95% CI, 3.0-5.5) for men and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.9-3.6) for\nwomen. Due to high rates of CVD deaths, CVD contributed\nto the largest number of years in the life expectancy gap\nbetween high-income and low-income men and women\n(Figure 3). CVD mortality did not, however, have the highest\nMRRS (Table).\nTrends in Life Expectancy by Income, 2005-2015\nThe gap in life expectancy between the bottom and top\nincome quartiles increased from 2.5 years (95% CI, 1.8-3.1) in\n2005 to 6.2 years (95% CI, 5.6-6.7) for women and from 6.2\nyears (95% CI, 5.5-6.9) to 8.4 years (95% CI, 7.7-8.9) for men\nin 2015 (Figure 4; eTable 3 in the Supplement). Life expec-\ntancy for women in the highest income quartile increased 3.2\nyears (95% CI, 2.7-3.7), while life expectancy for women in\nthe lowest income quartile decreased 0.4 years (95% CI, -1.0\nto 0.2). For men, life expectancy increased 3.1 years (95% CI,\n2.5-3.7) in the highest income quartile and 0.9 years (95% CI,\n0.2-1.6) in the lowest income quartile.\nIn 2005, the mortality rate for individuals aged 85 years\nand older was higher in the top income quartile compared with\nthe bottom income quartile for both men and women. Thus,\nthe older age groups reduced the overall gap in life expес-\ntancy by income. In 2015 this trend was reversed, with a higher\nmortality rate in the bottom income quartile compared with\nthe top income quartile for individuals aged 85 years and older\n(eTable 3 in the Supplement).\nTime trends in age-standardized cause-specific mortality\nrates varied by income (Figure 5).

Estimates were based on the\ntotal Norwegian population aged at least 40 years, excluding individuals with the lowest 3% income and individuals with immigrant background.\nmortality (including lung cancer) was stable at 35 deaths per\n100 000 men and 22 deaths per 100 000 women from 2005\nto 2015. In high-income groups, cancer mortality decreased\nduring that period from 26 (95% CI, 25-27) to 22 (95% CI, 21-\n23) deaths per 100 000 men and from 18 (95% CI, 17-18) to 15\n(95% CI, 14-15) deaths per 100 000 women. CVD mortality de-\ncreased from 35 (95% CI, 33-37) to 20 (95% CI, 19-21) deaths\nper 100 000 high-income men and from 51 (95% CI, 49-53) to\n36 (95% CI, 35-38) deaths per 100 000 low-income men. Com-\npared with other detailed causes of death, lung cancer, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary diseases and dementia (including\nAlzheimer disease) showed time trends that differed the most\nby income and sex (eFigure 7 in the Supplement).\nThe life expectancy curve was shifted upward when ex-\ncluding the population living in households with zero pen-\nsionable income, indicating that life expectancy was higher\nwhen this group was excluded from analysis (eFigure 1 in the\nSupplement). Results from analyses in which immigrants were\nincluded were similar to results of analyses that excluded im-\nmigrants (eTable 2 in the Supplement), except at the lower tail.\nMeasuring income at the age of 61 years for individuals aged\n63 years or older, and alterations to the number of lags for the\nincome variable, did not change interpretations of results (eFig-\nures 2 and 3 in the Supplement).\nComparisons Between Norway and the United States\nThe Norwegian study population that was generated to allow\ncomparison between Norway and the United States excluded\nhouseholds with zero pensionable income (7%) and the 2% of\nthe population with the lowest income, a total exclusion of 9%.\nIndividuals in the excluded 9% accounted for 31% of all deaths\nfrom age 40 to 63 years. This exclusion reduced the associa-\ntion between income and life expectancy (eFigure 1 in the\nSupplement).\nThe US estimates from Chetty et al¹ showed a near-linear\nassociation between income and life expectancy except for\nwith the lowest income percentiles (Figure 6A). Results from\nNorway showed similar differences in life expectancy with in-\ncome levels. Life expectancy was higher in Norway than in the\nUnited States in all income percentiles, except for the highest\nincome percentiles, in which life expectancies were similar in\nthe 2 countries.

When comparing absolute income levels\n(Figure 7), life expectancy in the lowest income percentiles in\nNorway aligned with somewhat higher income percentiles\nin the United States, and the differences between Norway\nand the United States were smaller throughout the distribu-\ntion in both men and women. Inclusion or exclusion of im-\nmigrants in comparisons with the United States did not alter\nthe interpretations.\nDiscussion\nIn Norway, the income-related gap in life expectancy in-\ncreased from 2005 to 2015. Income-related differences in CVD\nmortality, followed by cancer mortality, in the individuals aged\n60 to 69 years contributed the most to the life expectancy gap.\nDifferences in life expectancy by income percentiles in Norway\nwere similar to differences observed in the United States, al-\nthough life expectancy was higher in Norway in the lower to\nmiddle part of the income distribution.\nTo construct comparable US and Norwegian study popu-\nlations, individuals with no income or income solely from dis-\nability benefits and other transfers were excluded from both\npopulations. The share of excluded individuals and excluded\ndeaths were of similar magnitude in both countries. The com-\nparison using absolute vs relative income suggests that the dif-\nference in life expectancy between Norway and the United\nStates in the lower to middle part of the income distribution\nmight be partly explained by higher absolute income among\nthe individuals in low-income percentiles in Norway. It has\nbeen argued that relative, rather than absolute, income is most\nimportant for health. 27 However, the findings of this study pro-\nvide support for absolute income being relevant in interna-\ntional comparison studies.

Estimates were based on comparable populations in\nNorway and the United States according to Chetty et al.¹ The top income\npercentile was omitted for scaling purposes. The mean household income for\nUS men in the top percentile was US $1.98 million and their expected age at\ndeath was 87.3 years. Corresponding numbers in Norwegian men were\nUS $0.53 million and 86.5 years. The mean household income for US women in\nthe top percentile was US $1.92 million and their expected age at death was\n88.9 years. Corresponding numbers in Norwegian women were US $0.51 million\nand 88.9 years. The income variable was pretax household income for both the\nUnited States and Norway. Norwegian kroner was translated into US dollars\nusing the 2011 individual consumption expenditure by household value of 9.797\nfrom the International Comparison Program (http://www.worldbank.org/en/\nprograms/icp#5).\nProgramme for comparing US and Norwegian incomes. 28 While\nthese estimates constitute a best effort by World Bank research-\ners, there are still uncertainties related to methodology and\ndata. Moreover, differences in private education, health,\nand social service expenses are difficult to account for.\nIn a period with increasing real income and stable\nincome inequalities (eFigure 6 in the Supplement) in Norway,\nthis study shows increasing differences in life expectancy\nby income in men and women. In the United States there was\nno apparent increase in life expectancy for individuals in\nthe lowest income quartile from 2001 to 2014.¹ In contrast,\nin Norway, there was an increase in life expectancy for men\nin the lowest income quartile from 2010 to 2015 but not for\nwomen. Smoking contributed to higher mortality in low-\nincome men and women.5 However, the 3-decade lag in the\nsmoking epidemic for women compared with men29 may\nhave contributed to increasing mortality rates for smoking-\nrelated causes of death for women in the lowest income\nquartile from 2005 to 2015 and, hence, the lack of increase in\nlife expectancy for these women. 30\nThe contribution of lung cancer, other cancers, respira-\ntory disease, and CVD to differences in life expectancy be-\ntween high- and low-income groups points to smoking as a con-\ntributing risk factor. Dementia (including Alzheimer disease),\nwhich showed similar trends by income quartile as deaths from\nlung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has\nbeen found to be associated with smoking.25 However, only\nabout 20% of the income-related differences in life expес-\ntancy were attributed to smoking in this study. Similar esti-\nmates of the contribution of smoking to income-related dif-\nferences in life expectancy were found for Norway from 1995\nto 2007 in a 2019 Nordic study.5\nThis study has several strengths. The use of record link-\nage at the individual level with nearly complete coverage of\nthe Norwegian population with causes of death, over an ex-\ntensive time period, allowed analyses and comparisons of dif-\nferent subgroups and investigations of consequences of meth-\nodological choices.\nLimitations\nThis study had several limitations. First, national tax rec-\nords do not capture undeclared income, leading to some\nmisclassification. 31 Second, the composition of the top in-\ncome earners changed in 2005 as a result of a preannounced\ntax reform implemented in 2006.32 However, by aggregating\nincome across 5 years, the implications of this change were re-\nduced. Third, the approach used in this study did not\naccount for income mobility occurring between the ages of\n40 to 63 years (ie, that some individuals move to other\nincome groups during this time). Accounting for income\nmobility may give less-pronounced income-life expectancy\ngradients. 33 Fourth, income percentile ranks were assigned\nwithin age and sex each year. Thus, individuals in the\nmiddle income groups at a young age will tend to move to\nlower income percentiles at higher ages because more low-\nincome individuals died at a younger age. The movement\ninto lower income percentiles is exacerbated by frailty\neffects, where the most frail individuals die at earlier ages,\nwhich can potentially lead to a crossover in mortality rates\nin which the lowest income groups may appear to have a\nlower mortality rate than higher income groups at very high\nages. 34 These effects could have led to underestimation\nof differences in life expectancy by income.

I finished it in a cafe, right about the same time I finished my coffee and my cherry cake. The cafe is in a beach town in Japan, where I have been for a very long time. Soon enough I’ll go home.\n\nWhen I say I have been here for a very long time, I mean that. I’ve been here for six months, which doesn’t sound very long until you remember that I’m twenty years old and that when you’re twenty years old six months can be a lifetime. A lot can change in six months. You can do a lot. You can get sick. You can get better. You can buy umbrellas. You can lose them. You can make friends. You can lose them. You can fall in love, and you can lose the love. You can find yourself. You can lose that, too.\n\nThere was a girl I met here, and after every date we would go for a walk. We went on a lot of walks together, just the two of us. I think it was five walks but each walk was very long and because they were the longest walks I had ever been on, just the two of us, we walked very far and covered a lot of distance. At least I did. I don’t think she moved very much if I’m being perfectly honest, but that’s okay. I moved enough for the both of us.\n\nWhen you think about it five walks is not a lot of walks. And at the end of the fifth walk it became very clear to me that the last one hadn’t been a real walk but a fake one, that like a lot of final moments it only meant something as an echo of previous moments and couldn’t stand up on its own.\n\nIt would be okay except I have a problem. I dream about her quite often. I’ll be falling asleep on the train and suddenly I’ll be dreaming about her. Or I’ll wake up early in the morning with barely enough energy to drag myself on that miserable walk to work, and I’ll realize I spent the whole night dreaming about her.\n\nI’m not sure what to do about it to be honest because I realized quite a long time ago that it wasn’t going to happen and I was sad for a while and then I was less sad for a while and then I suppose I was back to normal. So no matter how much I think about it, I can’t seem to figure out why I dream about her so often, or what to do.\n\nWe don’t even have sex in the dreams, either. That would be normal I think. In the dreams we just sit next to each other and talk, or walk and talk, or go to some building and talk. We don’t talk about much. I think I might be in love with her, or at least some part of me wants me to think I am, which is especially odd be\ncause\nI don’t think I know anything about her.\nAnd I’m confident she doesn’t know anything about me.\nBut I know that a very subtle, very attractive accent creeps into her voice when she says sorry, and that when she’s eating it matters to her if I’m eating too, and that every so often her smile gets so sweet the rest of the world looks bitter by comparison.\nI think if I had someone to talk to I wouldn’t have fallen in love with her, which probably means I never really did.\nBut boys like me aren’t supposed to feel like this.\nI know that much for sure.\nWhen I finished *A Farewell to Arms* and my coffee and my cherry cake today in a cafe in Japan I almost cried, and though I didn’t I guess I looked very sad because the fat French man sitting at the table next to me kept looking over at me as if he were confused.\nI’m cursed with big eyes.\nBoys like me aren’t supposed to have feelings like this, but when they do they especially aren’t supposed to look like they have them.\nIt’s off-putting.\nBut when I get emotional I look it, and since people aren’t trained to recognize sadness in a face like mine they assume my face is wrong for some other reason.\nTrust me, I’m a good read of faces.\nMine can be very off-putting.\nI like to think my best quality as a writer is that I’m honest.\nNo matter what I write I’m honest.\nEven when I’m lying I’m telling the truth, and because I spend every moment of every day lying I really know what it means to tell the truth.\nBut it’s a double-edged sword.\nWhen I’m being honest even though I am still lying I also have to tell the truth, and when I tell the truth everyone can see how much I’ve been lying, so I have to write pieces like this and keep them hidden somewhere no one will see.\nIt’s a real problem.\nI’m cursed with big eyes.\nAnyway in this book, *A Farewell to Arms*, a man falls in love with a woman and she gets pregnant and has a baby and both she and the baby die in childbirth and that’s the ending.\nYou might be mad at me for spoiling it right now, but I promise you’ll forget because endings don’t stick in the mind if you didn’t spend any time with the middle.\nEndings are just words.\nYou know they’re coming and you know nothing is coming after that, so just like how the middle only matters because you’re on the way to an ending, an ending doesn’t matter because there’s nothing coming next.\nI’ve been in Japan for six months, but when I think about it I’ve only been in Japan for three months.\nThat was when I realized it wasn’\nGoing to happen with the girl and the walks stopped.\nSomeone might say that the first three months were Japan and the second three months were just normal life, and someone else might say that the second three months were Japan and the first three months were something entirely different.\nHaving lived all six I can see both sides.\nYou have to understand that this story only makes sense if I was never in love.\nIf I’m in love it makes a different kind of sense, but a crazy one, and you really would have to be warped to understand it much less live it.\nBut if I’m not in love that means this isn’t a crazy story and that all I’ve done here is learn something very important and very true which might be even scarier than being crazy.\nI came to this beach town today to finish reading this book and to start writing a new chapter of my own, and I came here to swim.\nBut the waves weren’t big enough to make it worth getting wet.\nSo I left the beach and I walked to the cafe, and since I had been planning on swimming I wasn’t wearing any underwear, which with the shorts I was wearing made me feel very exposed, very outlined if you know what I’m saying.\nI don’t think anyone noticed, though.\nWhich is interesting because I think if I were a girl I would notice.\nI notice a lot about girls who are strangers, especially the little things.\nI mean yes I notice how pretty their face is and I notice what they’re wearing and how big their breasts are and all of that stuff.\nBut I also notice the precise tone of their voice, and how happy or sad they are based on the way they walk, and whether they seem to like little kids or hate them.\nThe odd thing is that once I know a girl, or at least want to know her, I don’t notice any of that.\nI won’t notice if she got a haircut or if the clothes she’s wearing look particularly nice today.\nI’ll have already picked the things I want to notice, like how pretty the accent in her voice is when she says sorry, and I’ll notice those things no matter what.\nAnd of course I’ll spend the whole time trying to make her laugh.\nI think I’d better stop writing this.\nYou’ve been patient enough with me, reading all this way.\nI just needed to find someone to talk to about the ending of A Farewell to Arms.\nAfter his wife and baby died the main character didn’t seem to have anything else left to write, and so he stopped, but I needed someone to keep going with.\nI guess I wanted to cry a little bit at just how lost he seemed to feel on the page after\nthe last page where there was just empty space because he didn’t know how to finish.\nAnd when I looked up *A Farewell to Arms* online the first thing I read was some analysis about how early in the book when she slaps him she demonstrates agency against the patriarchy but later on because she says she would do whatever he wants since she’s in love with him she lost her agency.\nAnd that all made me feel a whole different kind of sad, because I think the author of *A Farewell to Arms* had big eyes just like me which people refused to see, or at least was an alcoholic.\nSo I needed to write something down.\nOnce I finished the book and the cherry cake and the coffee there was a closed book and an empty plate and an empty mug sitting in front of me.\nThey looked very nice just sitting there like that.\nI guess I wanted more but there wasn’t anything left.\nSoon I’ll be leaving Japan.\nIt’s probably a good thing.\nI did everything I wanted to do here, or at least I tried, so I’ve got to be ready to go home.\nAfter all, I’ve been away for a very long time.\n\nPiece 2:\nIn Throe\nBefore I start the walk from my apartment to the park, I study my palms.\nThere are all types of lines and marks and crossings there, running north and south and west, too.\nWhen I was a kid, I worried endlessly at the long, tapering streak which swelled just below my pinky, only to reach an undignified end just before my pointer finger.\nBack then, still ballooning into the world, I would caress each line, and wonder.\nAfter reviewing both palms, I return my left hand to my side and use the right to lock the door behind me.\nAs I step out into the street, I realize it is past eleven.\nMusic is playing from bars nearby, lit neon red signs and people spilling out from saloon doors into the street where they step around homeless sleepers and dodge hand-in-pocket passers-by.\nTurning right into a darker alley which leads to the park, I imagine I blend into the night.\nThat I am just a silhouette, an invisible shade garbed in a black up-turned coat and chocolate brown skin who can melt into the void of the unlit facades.\nFor a long time I did not walk alone.\nWe walked together—there used to be two of us, because there is supposed to be another—in the early mornings when people are with their dogs and smile at strangers.\nWhen I think back, I wonder if I knew what I was about to not have.\nI think the answer is yes.\nI always knew, have always known, to the bounds of my memory, even when I was a child.\nNow, a\nApproaching a crosswalk, I see a group of girls walking in my direction. My chest tightens with anxiety. They are a swirl of pretty and blonde and dark and their short skirts swish in the cold nighttime air which caresses with searching fingers the warmth of all exposed skin. I empty my eyes. I can tell from the periphery of my vision that they are giggling, all of them giggling, a protective charm against tall dark men like me whose faces have no expression and who articulate from the open sewer drains and unmanaged refuse which litters the street. Near the park, the road slants upwards. I have been sitting since morning, so I can feel the joints in my hip groan as I begin to step over the sleeping figure spanning the sidewalk. He mumbles something in his sleep. It is a fact that people mumble in their sleep. My older brother did not mumble, so until about six months ago, I did not know the truth of it. She had a lot to say. My foot is still moving, almost in slow motion, over this spokesperson, this itinerant of the conscious and unconscious worlds. Across the street a man is yelling. His arms are twitching, and I cannot make out his face. "Fuck you fuck I didn't know slithering it come dog my god fuck shit it's wow didn't how know so soon why" he is saying. I am grateful my eyes are already empty and unfocused, uncompromisingly and undeniably absent from any sphere of interpersonality. But then, just as my right foot touches the ground, the muscles below my waist freeze. I pause, unmoving. Beneath me, in between my legs, is a man mumbling under his breath. I consider now that we have become a mathematical equation, a Greek lambda stretched over a symbol of division. The streetlamp directly above my head switches on. Around us the entire alleyway is unlit, the entire block, but beneath this lonely spotlight we two are bathed in a dome of illumination. Beyond the swirling blizzard of dust and powder exposed by the focused beam in the darkness, the streets around us fade to an invisible opacity. The screaming goes silent; we two are alone. The muscles of my neck creak as they guide my head downwards. The man beneath me has been dressed in a pristine brown overcoat and stained corduroy pants. He has mismatched socks, both purple, and heavy boots with a thick sole. He is sleeping on a piece of cardboard with eyes wide open. He mumbles in his sleep. When I was nine years old I had a little white dog named Cookie. After a long walk I would set him next to me\npressed\non the outside of my left leg, and open a book.\nI would feel his little belly swell and deflate against my thigh with each breath.\nIn between turns of the page I would run my fingers through his white fur.\nWhen my parents would enter the house, a chaos of motion and sound, me and Cookie would continue there on the old, indented cushions of the couch.\nFor a long time Cookie and I sat like that.\nI lean downwards, assuming a squatting position just out of contact with the man's coat, my feet still stuck, motionless.\nHis lips are moving relentlessly, the sound of escaping air magnetically attractive to my ear.\nI stretch my right palm out and set it against the cold pavement, transferring my weight from my legs to my arm.\nFrom there I slowly lower my body closer and closer to his mouth.\nMy arm quivers, my elbow bends, my whole body shakes with exertion.\nJust before I meet his lips, I turn my head.\nI feel his breath, first as a vague intimation along my jawbone, then as a humid warmth which expands from my ear to the entirety of my right cheek.\nI listen to his words.\nI think about all the people, within this city and without, who are alone on this frigid summer night.\nI imagine being there with them, imagine the company I could provide.\nI start to swell, bigger and bigger, start to feel how much I am, how all-encompassing my presence is.\nThe man's eyes are yellower than his teeth but that is okay; I mumble too: Everything is okay, now.\nOn the bus sometimes a woman with frizzy hair and a meth-addled face twitches her way to the seat next to me.\nWhen the officer comes by to check our tickets he just shakes his head.\nThere is a dome of light around us.\nI can hear your story.\nEventually, he finishes.\nI look back at him, and his lips settle to a final stillness, the edges curved slightly upwards, a homeostatic state of peace.\nAs his eyes drift shut, I am overwhelmed with a sense of wholeness.\nThe overhead streetlamp begins to dim, darker and darker, until the light goes out and the snowy, dusting deluge disappears into the ether from whence it was pulled.\nIn one of the apartments above us, I can make out the gentle glow of string lights.\nThrough an open window the sound of EDM plays, a thrumming, heavy beat laid over the creaking of a bed frame.\nThe man across the street is still yelling, and I come unstuck, my foot completing the step.\nWhen I enter the park I look down at my watch and see that a long time has passed since I left my building.\nThe\nBenches are occupied, so I crouch beneath a flowering tree and look upwards.\nThere is a perceptual trick to the crisscrossing lines and branches, a sense of descending vision through the cracks.\nStars grimace from underneath leaves falling towards the sky.\nI put in my earbuds and play our song.\nWhen she left me it did not feel bad, did not feel like anything at all.\nI knelt on the hardwood tiles by our bed, raised my head to the mattress, and forced my vision to fix onto the covers, absolutely unmoving, the way I imagine Zen monks can for days and days which unfold without end.\nAfter a time the blankets started to shift, started to pulse and breathe like ocean waves in the oncoming evening tide.\nAnd finally, I felt a tremendous fear, because anything was possible.\nAs I walk back from the park, I notice the glint of my watch as it projects a sharpened glare into the eyes of a sleeping figure on a nearby bench.\nI conceal my left hand in my pocket and continue walking.\nBefore long I have returned to the alleyway, where across the street the man is still crying, yelling, releasing a low, long series of unintelligible phrases.\nFour times he said five fuck she didn’t ooh that’s one more night four into fucker going he streams.\nParked next to the sidewalk is an ambulance, and walking by I shield my eyes from the blinding reddish orange light it casts in all directions.\nThe window above us shuts and the music muffles, then turns silent.\nThere are paramedics’ voices and a body bag is zipped shut and I hide, melting into the silhouettes of the buildings.\nBefore long, my shadow returns to my door.\nI stare down at my palms and see how much has passed.\nInside my apartment the bed is made and I am unable to think of anything except how tired I am, deep in my stomach, like a skyscraper who suddenly finds three floors have gone missing from the middle, no choice but to fold in half.\nI collapse into my bed and reach my right arm out to the end of the covers, the rest of my body still.\nI wonder what stories I will tell tonight.	2024-12-22 23:55:28.982506	2024-12-22 23:55:28.982508	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Levinthal tutorial submission-3829", "chunks_count": 7}

This occurs most densely in Lolita’s Foreword, which is a collage of possible readerly postures. Caught in Nabokov’s web, it is easy to forget that many of those postures, such as the desire for social workers and educators to be more vigilant protectors of children, are reasonable and easy to accept. But it is John Ray Jr’s prosaicness, his banal moral position, which dissolves in contact with Lolita. As proof of that moral dissolution, to John, Lolita is a “tempest in a test tube,” a demonstration of an act more than 12% of adult American males “enjoy yearly,” and whose author, had he come in contact with a competent psychopathologist, would have caused no disaster. So we understand early that this John’s position is absurd; we even see it quickly compromised when he suffices to say that Humbert is “abnormal” and “not a gentleman” before praising “how majestically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author.” With this front-loaded guide on how to not read the book—to merely abhor the author while delighting in his gorgeous aesthetics—Nabokov does not simply separate aesthetics from morality, nor does he only problematize aesthetics as something potentially obfuscatory towards proper morals. Instead, he is laying the groundwork for a morality that does not contain aesthetics, but is re and co-defined by its two-way relationship with aesthetics. This we see most clearly stated on page 283 of Lolita, when Humbert says:\n\n“Unless it can be proven to me… that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. To quote an old poet: ‘The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.’”\n\nIn other words, morals are the tax we pay to legitimize and enable our aesthetic appreciation. Though the co-definition of morals and aesthetics in Lolita is not nearly so simple, that subtle act of reconstituting moral goodness appears also in the afterword, when Nabokov identifies the purpose of fiction to be aesthetic bliss, which allows connection with other states of artistic being, where curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy are nurtured. But if this gives us some vague, somewhat unstable picture of how morals might be defined as a compassionate dilution of aesthetic objectification, how do we reverse the definition — in Nabokov’s world, what defines aesthetics, and do they have a metaphysics?\n\nRichard Rorty takes direct issue with Nabokov’s aesthetics. He argues that Nabokov insightfully, if not originally, identifies psychological associations and personal history as the origin of our moral and aesthetic behavior. He sees these Freudian idiosyncratic origins as temporal and individual, and therefore not the grounds for the higher bliss Nabokov maintains as vital to fiction. But this supposed temporality, I think, is what Nabokov cleverly erodes in Pnin, allowing him to trace aesthetics in a more complex and transcendent manner.\n\nEarly in Pnin, Professor Pnin is having a stroke of sorts in a park of Whitchurch, on his way to deliver a speech in Cremona. Nabokov jokes, via his narrator, that Pnin’s sensation of sliding back to his own childhood is what a veteran psychoanalyst might explain as re-experiencing one’s baptism. But what we are shown as the “explosion of intervening recollection” seems to be nothing less than an alternate explanation to the ridiculous psychoanalytic one of Pnin’s stroke, or panic attacks—that is, the origin of Pnin’s anxiety, which manifests throughout the novel. We are told at the beginning of Pnin’s recollection that everything started with a strange chill that pervaded his body, but it’s unclear if this an actual fever chill, since his mother, who is described as a frail, nervous little person, simply looks at his temperature with stupefaction. She calls the doctor, but only after the doctor leaves—in fact, “no sooner had the doctor left” than she and a servant girl wrap poor Timofey in soaked linen, absorbent cotton, and sticky, diabolical oilcloth, the hue of urine and fever. Indeed, we’re told that these were of no avail against the branching chill of his ribs. If we envision a scenario in which sad, studying Pnin has been victimized by his mother’s anxiety of chills by being wrapped in this horrible cocoon, then the subsequent scene of aesthetic birth, in which he tries to find the key to the pattern of life in the flowers he is restricted to stare at takes on significance not as idiosyncratic fever but very real trauma. The anxious association and strength of this trauma is only magnified on page 24, when it is the “sense of being late for some appointment as odiously exact as school, dinner, or bedtime” which “added the discomfort of awkward haste to the difficulties of a quest that was grading into delirium.” It is then, in this seemingly unbearable moment, that the foliage of the flowers detaches, loses its flatness, and dissolves into a form of aesthetic bliss. And thus adult Pnin, in the park having a panic attack about missing his presentation, at every turn being thwarted by incorrect schedules and poorly placed papers, is thrust back to the source of the trauma which caused his anxiety, and his aesthetics, to germinate. Pnin’s pathological fear of pneumonia is linked with his panic attacks, as in the park he immediately worries of pneumonia, and throughout the novel repeatedly and insistently focuses on the hearty American drafts, the wind, the cold, and the electric heaters.\n\nVia this superficially silly story one is reminded of Marcel Proust, of that legendary author’s debilitating and surely terrifying bouts of severe asthma, and of his at least partially autobiographical childhood character in the first volume of In Search of Lost Time. In that volume, Marcel’s overwhelming and inescapable nervous pathology leads him to cloister himself in his room, waiting for a good night kiss from his mother and, in his anxious isolation and general inability to play outside, weaving fantastic stories from the lamplight on the wall. Proust’s father was a neurologist who specialized in nervous disorders and believed Proust to have a mental abnormality of neurasthenia rather than his severe, breath-stealing asthma; thus we have the picture of two characters, little Marcel and poor Pnin, who, traumatized by an incomprehensible system which smashed against the restrictive moral and medical allowances of their childhood, birthed an aesthetic sense which punctures subsequent time.\n\nDespite the horrors of adult Humbert, one must not forget to be empathetic towards the brutal reality of childhood Humbert’s experience losing his first, and by some definitions only, true love. Though Humbert’s couching of his loss in Poe’s poem creates an air of aestheticized falsity, late in the novel, when he realizes “the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised–the great rosegray never-to-be-had,” are we only tricked by Humbert, or is there a shred of truth? And one cannot forget that his experiences with Annabelle were constantly limited by the social realities permitted by their caretakers—perhaps we can say Humbert’s constant obsession with the transgressive is a scintillation between a desire to securely satisfy and utterly destroy the societal norms which, in combination with typhus, ensured the rosegray could never be had. After all, Humbert says he was “perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for.” Here, the demoniac is not only the nymphophilic monstrosity it becomes, but, unrecognized by Humbert, also a misanthropic loathing of societal rules, compressed by his experiences with childhood sexuality, which incubates in his uniquely sociopathic mind to become his awful crime.\n\nSimilarly, in order for Pnin to “exist rationally,” he must not remember Mira Belochkin, because that memory coincides with a sense of diffusion and dilation within his chest which the narrator identifies early with death. Like all of these characters, Pnin experiences the moment where the mind remembers an otherworldly tragedy: “no conscience, and hence no consciousness, could be expected to subsist in a world where such things as Mira’s death were possible.” And this tightness in Pnin’s chest, this dissolutive experience, articulates on the page with the narrator’s description of Gramineev’s easel. This moment is for Pnin, like for Proust, and for Humbert, the result of an atemporal rupture in the supposedly transcendent metaphysics of prevailing moral systems, a trauma which was lodged in consciousness and yet disallows all consciousness, and which is the birthplace of Nabokov’s aesthetic tingle. Because as readers we know what it is impossible for the narrator to see — that the two dark figures on the easel, silhouettes in profile against the ember-red sky, are not the Poroshin girl and her beau, or Nina Bolotov and young Poroshin; they are Pnin, and Mira.	2025-01-08 00:59:58.76643	2025-01-08 00:59:58.766433	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-final presentation-8827", "chunks_count": 6}

This is a number that is random. Define the\nrandom variable\nX = number of tails in four tosses\nX is a discrete random variable since it takes values in the\ndiscrete set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. You can compute the probabilities\nthat X takes on these outcomes:\n4\n1\nP(X = 0) = P(no tails in four tosses) =\n(\n2\n)\nP(X = 1) = P(THHH or HTHH or HHTH or HHHT) = 4\nand so on.\n4\n1\n(\n2\n)\n4\n1\n=\n4\n\nIn general, if X takes values in a discrete set {X1, X2, ...} and\nwe set p(xi) = P(X = x;), then p(x) is called a probability\nmass function or frequency function.\nNote that Σ; p(xi) = 1.\nSometimes it is easier to work with the cumulative\ndistribution function (cdf) F(x) = P(X ≤ x).\nAn important special case of random variable is an indicator\nrandom variable\n1A =\n{:\n1 if A occurs\n0 if A does not occur\nSo we can write the above X as\nX = 1A1 + 1A2 + 1A3 + 1A4,\nwhere the event Ai = 'tails on the ith toss'.\n\nHere are some important probability mass functions (also\ncalled distributions):\nIf X is the number of successes in n independent trials, each of\nwhich results in success with probability p, then X has the\nbinomial distribution with parameters n and p. It is given by\nn\nP(X=k) = (R) pk (1-p)n-k.\nIf X is the number of trials until (and including) the first success\nin these independent trials, then\nP(X = k) = p(1-p)k-1\nThis is the geometric distribution with parameter p.\nاراار\n\nIf an urn has n balls, r of which are red and n - r of which are\nwhite, and we draw m balls without replacement and X is the\nnumber of red balls, then\n\nP(X = k) =\n(r) (n-r)\n(k) (m-k)\n(n)\n(m)\n\nwhich is the hypergeometric distribution. Note that if we draw\nwith replacement, then X is binomial(m, r/n).\nFinally, the Poisson distribution with parameter λ ≥ 0 is\n\nP(X = k) = λk e-λ ,  k = 0, 1, 2, . . .\nk!\n\nThe Poisson distribution comes up in a setting where there is a\nlarge number of independent trials, each with a small\nprobability of success, i.e. as the limit of a binomial(n, p) with\nlarge n and np ≈ λ.\n\nRandom variables can also be continuous, then the density\nf(x) plays the role of the frequency function:\nP(a< X < b) =\nb\nf\na\nf(x) dx,\nso F(t) =\nt\nf' f(x)dx.\nU[a, b] is the uniform distribution on [a, b] with density\nf(x)\n=\n{\n1\nb−a\nif x ∈ [a, b]\n0\nelse.\nThe exponential density with parameter λ > 0 is\nf(x) =\n{\nλε−λx\nif x > 0\n0\nelse.\nand one checks that F(t) = 1 – e−λt for t ≥ 0.\n\nIf X has the normal distribution with mean µ and standard\ndeviation σ > 0 (for short: X ~ N(μ, σ²)), then its density is\nφ(x) =\n1\nσ√2π\ne−12(x−μσ)2\n.\nIts cdf Φμ,σ(t) = ∫−∞t φ(x) dx does not have a closed-form\nexpression.\n\nFunctions of a random variable\nIf X has density fx(x), then what is the density of Y = ax + b?\nIt's easiest to first calculate the cdf, then take its derivative to\nget the density:\nFy(t) = P(Y ≤ t) = P(ax + b ≤ t)\n= P(X ≤ t-b/a)\n= Fx (t-b/a)\nassume a > 0\nSo fy(t) = d/dt Fx (t-b/a) = 1/a fx (t-b/a)	2025-01-08 22:27:54.045489	2025-01-08 22:27:54.04549	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Lecture 2-6962", "chunks_count": 8}

But\nthis did not entitle them to dominate other Sunni Muslim states and when\nOttoman arms first attempted to overthrow rival Muslim rulers throughout Asia\nMinor, religious resistance developed. In 1502 the threat increased when the\nhead of the Safavid family, Ismail, proclaimed himself shah and quickly built an\nempire directly to the east of the Ottoman frontier. Ismail's success depended on\nhis followers' belief that his descent (probably fictitious) from Muhammad's son-\nin-law `Ali made him the true and only legitimate successor to the Prophet. Such\na claim implied that all other Muslim rulers were usurpers, including the Ottoman\nsultans. This doctrine was especially explosive because large numbers of people\nin Asia Minor were predisposed to accept such an idea. For generations a semi-\nsecret Shi`ite propaganda had taught that the rulers of Islam were all illegitimate,\nand that the true head of the Muslim community, the Imam, would appear\nsomeday to overthrow the mighty and set all things right. Ismail's meteoric career\nseemed to match such expectations, and the many views which had developed\nabout how and when the Imam would manifest himself tended to coalesce\naround his person. Sultan Selim I responded to this challenge by resorting to\nterror against those in his domains suspected of sympathizing with Shah Ismail.\nHe massacred many thousands in eastern Asia Minor and then marched on\nTabriz, Ismail's new capital. Selim's Ottoman forces defeated Ismail and his army\nat Chaldiran (1514) and occupied Tabriz, but could not hold it because the town\nwas too far from Constantinople. The result was a stand-off, each ruler remaining\nsupreme within his own frontiers. Before the battle of Chaldiran, Selim and Ismail\nexchanged a number of letters. The two of these letters translated below are not\ndated, but were probably written sometime in 1514. Ismail's letter, apparently the\nonly one he wrote, came in reply to three Selim had written, one of which is\ntranslated below. The letters were, in fact, a form of propaganda. Selim set out to\ndefend his right to rule by quoting from the Quran and alluding to examples from\nhistory which buttressed his claims. Ismail, who based his claims on heredity,\nhad no need of such leaming; rather he quotes from seemingly contemporary\nPersian poetry and appears almost casual, if not insolent, in addressing his rival.]\n1. LETTER FROM SELIM TO ISMAIL (UNDATED, AROUND 1514)\n"It is from Solomon and it is: 'In the Name of God, the Merciful, the\nCompassionate. Rise not up against me, but come to me in surrender.'"[Quran\n27:30-31] God's blessings upon the best of his creatures, Muhammad, his family,\nand his companions all. "This is a Scripture We have sent down, blessed; so\nfollow it, and be godfearing; haply so you will find mercy." [Quran 6:156]\nThis missive which is stamped with the seal of victory and which is, like inspiration\ndescending from the heavens, witness to the verse "We never chastise until We\nsend forth a Messenger" [Quran XVII: i5] has been graciously issued by our most\n\nglorious majesty-we who are the Caliph of God Most High in this world, far and\nwide; the proof of the verse "And what profits men abides in the earth" [Quran XIII:\n17) the Solomon of Splendor, the Alexander of eminence; haloed in victory,\nFaridun [an ancient and celebrated king of Persia, who began to reign about 750\nBCE] triumphant; slayer of the wicked and the infidel, guardian of the noble and\nthe pious; the warrior in the Path, the defender of the Faith; the champion, the\nconqueror; the lion, son and grandson of the lion; standard-bearer of justice and\nrighteousness, Sultan Selim Shah, son of Sultan Bayezid, son of Sultan\nMuhammad Khan--and is addressed to the ruler of the kingdom of the Persians,\nthe possessor of the land of tyranny and perversion, the captain of the vicious, the\nchief of the malicious, the usurping Darius [Probably Darius III (r. 336-330 BCE),\nwho was defeated three times by Alexander the Great before his assassination by\nthe satrap of Bactria. Selim is alluding to current Ottoman-Safavid relations.] of\nthe time, the malevolent Zahhak [a mythological king of Iran notorious for blood-\nthirstiness] of the age, the peer of Cain, Prince Ismail.\nAs the Pen of Destiny has drawn up the decree "Thou givest the kingdom to\nwhom Thou wilt" [Quran 3:26] in our sublime name and has signed it with the\nverse "Whatsoever mercy God opens to men, none can withhold" [Quran 35:2], it\nis manifest in the Court of Glory and the Presence of Deity that we, the\ninstrument of Divine Will, shall hold in force upon the earth both the\ncommandments and prohibitions of Divine Law as well as the provisions of royal\nproclamations. "That is the bounty of God; he gives it unto whomsoever He will."\n[Quran 57:21]\nIt has been heard repeatedly that you have subjected the upright community of\nMuhammad (Prayers and salutations upon its founder!) to your devious will, that\nyou have undermined the firm foundation of the Faith, that you have unfurled the\nbanner of oppression in the cause of aggression, that you no longer uphold the\ncommandments and prohibitions of the Divine Law, that you have incited your\nabominable Shi`i faction to unsanctified sexual union and to the shedding of\ninnocent blood [reference to uncanonical practices, such as temporary marriage.\nThe shedding of blood could be a reference to Shi'i massacres of Sunnis at\nTabriz and elsewhere] that like they "Who listen to falsehood and consume the\nunlawful" [Quran 5:42] you have given ear to idle deceitful words and have eaten\nthat which is forbidden [a further reference to illegitimate (from Sunni\nperspective) practices condoned by Shi'ites]:\nHe has laid waste to mosques, as it is said, Constructing idol temples in their\nstead, that you have torn the noble fiber of Islam with the hand of tyranny, and\nthat you have called the Glorious Quran the myths of the Ancients. The rumor of\nthese abominations has caused your name to become like that of Harith\ndeceived by Satan.\nIndeed, as both the fatwas of distinguished `ulama who base their opinion on\nreason and tradition alike and the consensus of the Sunni community agree that\n\nthe ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil\ninnovation must be the aim of our exalted aspiration, for "Religious zeal is a\nvictory for the Faith of God the Beneficent"; then, in accordance with the words of\nthe Prophet (Peace upon him!) "Whosoever introduces evil innovation into our\norder must be expelled" and "Whosoever does aught against our order must be\nexpelled," action has become necessary and exigent. Thus, when the Divine\nDecree of Eternal Destiny commended the eradication of the infamously wicked\ninfidels into our capable hands, we set out for their lands like ineluctable fate\nitself to enforce the order "Leave not upon the earth of the Unbelievers even\none." [Quran 71:26] If God almighty wills, the lightning of our conquering sword\nshall uproot the untamed bramble grown to great heights in the path of the\nrefulgent Divine Law and shall cast them down upon the dust of abjectness to be\ntrampled under the hooves of our legions, for "They make the mightiest of its\ninhabitants abased. Even so they too will do" [Quran XXVII: 341; the thunder of\nour avenging mace shall dash out the muddled brains of the enemies of the Faith\nas rations for the lionhearted ghazis . "And those who do wrong shall surely know\nby what overthrowing they will be overthrown." [Quran 26: 227]\nBut "Religion is Counsel," and should you turn the countenance of submission to\nthe qibla of bliss and the Ka'ba of hope--our angelic threshhold, the refuge of the\nnoble--moreover, should you lift up the hand of oppression from the heads of\nyour subjects ruined by tyranny and sedition, should you take up a course of\nrepentance, become like one blameless and return to the sublime straight path of\nthe Sunna of Muhammad (Prayers and salutations upon him and God's\nsatisfaction upon his immaculate family and his rightly-guided companions all!) . .\nand should you consider your lands and their people part of the well-protected\nOttoman state, then shall you be granted our royal favor and our imperial\npatronage.\nHe whose face touches the dust of my threshold in submission will be enveloped\nin the shadow of my favor and my justice. How great the happiness of him who\ncomplies with this!\nOn the other hand, if your evil, seditious habits have become a part of your\nnature, that which has become essential can never again be accidental. What\navail sermons to the black-hearted?\nThen, with the support and assistance of God, I will crown the head of every\ngallows tree with the head of a crown-wearing Sufi and clear that faction from the\nface of the earth-"The party of God, they are the victors" [Quran 5:56]; I will break\nthe oppressors' grip with the power of the miraculous white hand of Moses, for\n"God's hand is over their hands." [Quran 48:10 ] Let them remove the cotton of\nnegligence from the ears of their intelligence and, with their shrouds on their\nshoulders, prepare themselves for "Surely that which you are promised will come\nto pass." [Quran 6:134] The triumphant troops "As though they were a building\nwell-compacted" [Quran 61:41] crying out like fate evoked "When their term\n\ncomes they shall not put it back a single hour nor put it forward" [Quran 7:34] and\nmaneuvering in accordance with "Slay them wherever you find them" [Quran\n4:89], will wreak ruin upon you and drive you from that land. "To God belongs the\ncommand before and after, and on that day the believers shall rejoice." [Quran\n30:4] "So the last roots of the people who did evil were cut off, Praise be to God,\nthe Lord of the Worlds." [Quran 6:45]\n2. ISMAIL TO SELIM (UNDATED, AROUND 1514)\nMay his godly majesty, the refuge of Islam, the might of the kingdom, he upon\nwhom God looks with favor, the champion of the sultanate and of the state, the\nhero of the faith and of the earth, Sultan Selim Shah (God grant him immortal\nstate and eternal happiness!) accept this affectionate greeting and this friendly\nletter, considering it a token of our good will.\nNow to begin: Your honored letters have arrived one after another, for "No\nsooner has a thing doubled than it has tripled." Their contents, although\nindicative of hostility, are stated with boldness and vigor. The latter gives us\nmuch enjoyment and pleasure, but we are ignorant of the reason for the former.\nIn the time of your late blessed father (May God enlighten his proof!) when our\nroyal troops passed through the lands of Rum [Anatolia] to chastise the\nimpudence of Ala al-Dawla Dhu'l-Qadr, complete concord and friendship was\nshown on both sides. Moreover, when your majesty was governor at Trebizond\n[i.e., before his accession] there existed perfect mutual understanding. Thus,\nnow, the cause of your resentment and displeasure yet remains unknown. If\npolitical necessity has compelled you on this course, then may your problems\nsoon be solved.\nDispute may fire words to such a heat\nThat ancient houses be consumed in flames.\nThe intention of our inaction in this regard is twofold:\n(1) Most of the inhabitants of the land of Rum are followers of our forefathers\n(May God the All-Forgiving King have mercy upon them!).\n(2) We have always loved the ghazi-titled Ottoman house and we do not wish the\noutbreak of sedition and turmoil once again as in the time of Timur.\nWhy should we then take umbrage at these provocations? We shall not.\nThe mutual hostility of kings is verily an ancient rite.\nShould one hold the bride of worldly rule too close,\n\nHis lips those of the radiant sword will kiss.\nNevertheless, there is no cause for improper words: indeed, those vain, heretical\namputations are the mere fabrications of the opium-clouded minds of certain\nsecretaries and scribes. We therefore think that our delayed reply was not\ncompletely without cause for we have now dispatched our honored personal\ncompanion and servant Shah Quli Aga (May he be sustained!) with a golden\ncasket stamped with the royal seal and filled with a special preparation for their\nuse should they deem it necessary.

Mine is the proverbial office watercooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged. I hope to enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the judgments and choices of others, the company’s new policies, or a colleague’s investment decisions. Why be concerned with gossip? Because it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own. Questioning what we believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult when we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions of others. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a powerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year resolutions to improve one’s decision making at work and at home. To be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of labels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its symptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and consequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness. Learning medicine consists in part of learning the language of medicine. A deeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer vocabulary than is available in everyday language. The hope for informed gossip is that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make. Systematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in particular circumstances. When the handsome and confident speaker bounds onto the stage, for example, you can anticipate that the audience will judge his comments more favorably than he deserves. The availability of a diagnostic label for this bias—the halo effect—makes it easier to anticipate, recognize, and understand. When you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally answer. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way. Most impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without your knowing how they got there.\n\nYou cannot trace how you came to the belief that there is a lamp on the desk in front of you, or how you detected a hint of irritation in your spouse’s voice on the telephone, or how\n\nIn memory of Amos Tversky\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nPart I.

The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and many decisions goes on in silence in our mind. Much of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition. However, the focus on error does not denigrate human intelligence, any more than the attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health. Most of us are healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are appropriate most of the time. As we navigate our lives, we normally allow ourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence we have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not always. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are. So this is my aim for watercooler conversations: improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest an intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often cause. Origins\n\nanswer. Amos and I enjoyed the exchange and concluded that intuitive statistics was an interesting topic and that it would be fun to explore it together. That Friday we met for lunch at Café Rimon, the favorite hangout of bohemians and professors in Jerusalem, and planned a study of the statistical intuitions of sophisticated researchers. We had concluded in the seminar that our own intuitions were deficient. In spite of years of teaching and using statistics, we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of statistical results observed in small samples. Our subjective judgments were biased: we were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research. The goal of our study was to examine whether other researchers suffered from the same affliction. We prepared a survey that included realistic scenarios of statistical issues that arise in research. Amos collected the responses of a group of expert participants in a meeting of the Society of Mathematical Psychology, including the authors of two statistical textbooks. As expected, we found that our expert colleagues, like us, greatly exaggerated the likelihood that the original result of an experiment would be successfully replicated even with a small sample. They also gave very poor advice to a fictitious graduate student about the number of observations she needed to collect. Even statisticians were not good intuitive statisticians. While writing the article that reported these findings, Amos and I discovered that we enjoyed working together. Amos was always very funny, and in his presence I became funny as well, so we spent hours of solid work in continuous amusement. The pleasure we found in working together made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. Perhaps most important, we checked our critical weapons at the door. Both Amos and I were critical and argumentative, he even more than I, but during the years of our collaboration neither of us ever rejected out of hand anything the other said. Indeed, one of the great joys I found in the collaboration was that Amos frequently saw the point of my vague ideas much more clearly than I did. Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and an unfailing sense of direction. I was more intuitive and rooted in the psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas.\n\nWe were sufficiently similar to understand each other easily, and sufficiently different to surprise each other. We developed a routine in which we spent much of our working days together, often on long walks. For the next fourteen years our collaboration was the focus of our lives, and the work we did together during those years was the best either of us ever did. We quickly adopted a practice that we maintained for many years. Our\n\nThis book presents my current understanding of judgment and decision making, which has been shaped by psychological discoveries of recent decades. However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I asked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the Department of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Amos Tversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research—indeed, in anything he did—so I knew we would have an interesting time. Many people who knew Amos thought he was the most intelligent person they had ever met. He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic. He was also blessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use them to make a point. There was never a dull moment when Amos was around. He was then thirty-two; I was thirty-five. Amos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the University of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people good intuitive statisticians? We already knew that people are good intuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules of grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist. Do people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics? Amos reported that the answer was a qualified yes. We had a lively debate in the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better\n\nResearch was a conversation, in which we invented questions and jointly examined our intuitive answers. Each question was a small experiment, and we carried out many experiments in a single day. We were not seriously looking for the correct answer to the statistical questions we posed. Our aim was to identify and analyze the intuitive answer, the first one that came to mind, the one we were tempted to make even when we knew it to be wrong. We believed—correctly, as it happened—that any intuition that the two of us shared would be shared by many other people as well, and that it would be easy to demonstrate its effects on judgments. We once discovered with great delight that we had identical silly ideas about the future professions of several toddlers we both knew. We could identify the argumentative three-year-old lawyer, the nerdy professor, the empathetic and mildly intrusive psychotherapist. Of course these predictions were absurd, but we still found them appealing. It was also clear that our intuitions were governed by the resemblance of each child to the cultural stereotype of a profession. The amusing exercise helped us develop a theory that was emerging in our minds at the time, about the role of resemblance in predictions. We went on to test and elaborate that theory in dozens of experiments, as in the following example. As you consider the next question, please assume that Steve was selected at random from a representative sample:\n\nAn individual has been described by a neighbor as follows: “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.” Is Steve more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?\n\nThe resemblance of Steve’s personality to that of a stereotypical librarian strikes everyone immediately, but equally relevant statistical considerations are almost always ignored. Did it occur to you that there are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United States? Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks. However, we found that participants in our experiments ignored the relevant statistical facts and relied exclusively on resemblance. We proposed that they used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic (roughly, a rule of thumb) to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions. On another occasion, Amos and I wondered about the rate of divorce among professors in our university. We noticed that the question triggered a search of memory for divorced professors we knew or knew about, and that we judged the size of categories by the ease with which instances came to mind. We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the availability heuristic. In one of our studies, we asked participants to answer a simple question about words in a typical English text:\n\nConsider the letter K. Is K more likely to appear as the first letter in a word OR as the third letter?\n\nrational, and their thinking is normally sound. Second, emotions such as fear, affection, and hatred explain most of the occasions on which people depart from rationality. Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly. We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by emotion. Our article attracted much more attention than we had expected, and it remains one of the most highly cited works in social science (more than three hundred scholarly articles referred to it in 2010). Scholars in other disciplines found it useful, and the ideas of heuristics and biases have been used productively in many fields, including medical diagnosis, legal judgment, intelligence analysis, philosophy, finance, statistics, and military strategy. For example, students of policy have noted that the availability heuristic helps explain why some issues are highly salient in the public’s mind while others are neglected. People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common. For several weeks after Michael Jackson’s death, for example, it was virtually impossible to find a television channel reporting on another topic. In contrast, there is little coverage of critical but unexciting issues that provide less drama, such as declining educational standards or overinvestment of medical resources in the last year of life. (As I write this, I notice that my choice of “little-covered” examples was guided by availability.\n\nThe topics I chose as examples are mentioned often; equally important issues that are less available did not come to my mind. We did not fully realize it at the time, but a key reason for the broad appeal of “heuristics and biases” outside psychology was an incidental feature of our work: we almost always included in our articles the full text of the questions we had asked ourselves and our respondents. These questions served as demonstrations for the reader, allowing him to recognize how his own thinking was tripped up by cognitive biases. I hope you had such an experience as you read the question about Steve the librarian, which was intended to help you appreciate the power of resemblance as a cue to probability and to see how easy it is to ignore relevant statistical facts.\n\nThe use of demonstrations provided scholars from diverse disciplines—notably philosophers and economists—an unusual opportunity to observe possible flaws in their own thinking. Having seen themselves fail, they became more likely to question the dogmatic assumption, prevalent at the time, that the human mind is rational and logical. The choice of method was crucial: if we had reported results of only conventional experiments, the article would have been less noteworthy and less memorable. Furthermore, skeptical readers would have distanced themselves from the results by attributing judgment errors to the familiar fecklessness of undergraduates, the typical participants in psychological studies. Of course, we did not choose demonstrations over standard experiments because we wanted to influence philosophers and economists. We preferred demonstrations because they were more fun, and we were lucky in our choice of method as well as in many other ways. A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome. Our story was no exception. The reaction to our work was not uniformly positive. In particular, our focus on biases was criticized as suggesting an unfairly negative view of the mind. As expected in normal science, some investigators refined our ideas and others offered plausible alternatives. By and large, though, the idea that our minds are susceptible to systematic errors is now generally accepted. Our research on judgment had far more effect on social science than we thought possible when we were working on it. Immediately after completing our review of judgment, we switched our attention to decision making under uncertainty. Our goal was to develop a psychological theory of how people make decisions about simple gambles. For example: Would you accept a bet on the toss of a coin where you win $130 if the coin shows heads and lose $100 if it shows tails? These elementary choices had long been used to examine broad questions about decision making, such as the relative weight that people assign to sure things and to uncertain outcomes. Our method did not change: we spent many days making up choice problems and examining whether our intuitive preferences conformed to the logic of choice.\n\nHere again, as in judgment, we observed systematic biases in our own decisions, intuitive preferences that consistently violated the rules of rational choice. Five years after the *Science* article, we published “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk,” a theory of choice that is, by some counts, more influential than our work on judgment, and is one of the foundations of behavioral economics.\n\nAs any Scrabble player knows, it is much easier to come up with words that begin with a particular letter than to find words that have the same letter in the third position. This is true for every letter of the alphabet. We therefore expected respondents to exaggerate the frequency of letters appearing in the first position—even those letters (such as K, L, N, R, V) which in fact occur more frequently in the third position. Here again, the reliance on a heuristic produces a predictable bias in judgments. For example, I recently came to doubt my long-held impression that adultery is more common among politicians than among physicians or lawyers. I had even come up with explanations for that “fact,” including the aphrodisiac effect of power and the temptations of life away from home. I eventually realized that the transgressions of politicians are much more likely to be reported than the transgressions of lawyers and doctors. My intuitive impression could be due entirely to journalists’ choices of topics and to my reliance on the availability heuristic. Amos and I spent several years studying and documenting biases of intuitive thinking in various tasks—assigning probabilities to events, forecasting the future, assessing hypotheses, and estimating frequencies. In the fifth year of our collaboration, we presented our main findings in Science magazine, a publication read by scholars in many disciplines. The article (which is reproduced in full at the end of this book) was titled “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.” It described the simplifying shortcuts of intuitive thinking and explained some 20 biases as manifestations of these heuristics—and also as demonstrations of the role of heuristics in judgment. Historians of science have often noted that at any given time scholars in a particular field tend to share basic assumptions about their subject. Social scientists are no exception; they rely on a view of human nature that provides the background of most discussions of specific behaviors but is rarely questioned. Social scientists in the 1970s broadly accepted two ideas about human nature. First, people are generally\n\nUntil geographical separation made it too difficult to go on, Amos and I enjoyed the extraordinary good fortune of a shared mind that was superior to our individual minds and of a relationship that made our work fun as well as productive. Our collaboration on judgment and decision making was the reason for the Nobel Prize that I received in 2002, which Amos would have shared had he not died, aged fifty-nine, in 1996. Where we are now\n\nday. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car in the next lane is dangerous. Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced firefighter or physician—only more common. The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic. Perhaps the best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess masters and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us. You can feel Simon’s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he writes: “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” We are not surprised when a two-year-old looks at a dog and says “doggie!” because we are used to the miracle of children learning to recognize and name things. Simon’s point is that the miracles of expert intuition have the same character. Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it. Good intuitive judgments come to mind with the same immediacy as “doggie!” Unfortunately, professionals’ intuitions do not all arise from true expertise. Many years ago I visited the chief investment officer of a large financial firm, who told me that he had just invested some tens of millions of dollars in the stock of Ford Motor Company. When I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had recently attended an automobile show and had been impressed. “Boy, do they know how to make a car!” was his explanation. He made it very clear that he trusted his gut feeling and was satisfied with himself and with his decision. I found it remarkable that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist would call relevant: Is Ford stock currently underpriced? Instead, he had listened to his intuition; he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he liked the idea of owning its stock. From what we know about the accuracy of stock picking, it is reasonable to believe that he did not know what he was doing.	2024-12-29 13:38:50.874307	2024-12-29 13:38:50.87431	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Daniel Kahneman - Thinking, Fast and Slow  -0882", "chunks_count": 16}

If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate.\n- checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate.\n- checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language.\n- checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square.\n- checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers.\n- checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square.\n- checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.\n\nThe verifier halts on all inputs because it’s given a certificate  n  which specifies how many steps  M  should take to return a result for  w .  <  M,w  >∈ ATM  only when there is a number of steps  n  which  M  takes to accept  w; if there was no number of steps, then  M  would loop infinitely, so we would not know if  <  M,w  > was in  ATM, and if  M  didn’t loop infinitely on  w, then there would be a number of steps  n  it took.\n\nProblem Three: Isn’t Everything Undecidable? i.\n\nIt breaks down at "This is impossible." The proof does not explain why it is impossible for  trickster(w)  to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L. In fact,  trickster  is defined exactly to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L, so it is behaving as expected.\n\nii.\n\nThis is wrong when it says "Since  willAccept  decides  L  and  me  holds the source code of  trickster, we know that  willAccept(me,input)  returns  true  if and only if  trickster(input)  returns  true." That is wrong because there’s nothing about  trickster(input)  that influences whether  willAccept(me,input)  would return true. That if and only if only applied in the  ATM  case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language  L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how  trickster  is written, we see that  isValid(me)  returns true if and only if  trickster  is not syntactically valid. This assumes that if  isValid  returns false, then in the else statement, having valid syntax means  trickster  has valid syntax. However,  trickster  has invalid syntax even if we branch into the  else  condition because invalid syntax doesn’t rely on which lines of the program get run; just having incorrect syntax earlier in the program makes it invalid even if the else condition is valid.\n\nProblem Four: Double Verification\n\nbool isInL(string w): − for (each string c) −− if checkInL(w, c) return true −− if checkInLBar(w, c) return false\n\nCS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Fall 2024\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 9 December 5, 2024\n\nProblem Six: co-RE and Beyond i.\n\nProof: We want to prove that ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know that ATM is recognizable; that is, for any word w ∈ Σ*, there exists a recognizer M which accepts w if and only if w ∈ ATM. Since ATM ∈ co-RE, we know for any w ∈ ATM that there exists a recognizer W which accepts w if and only if w ∉ ATM. Thus, since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, ATM is decidable, since a language is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are recognizable. However, ATM is not decidable, as proven by self-reference in Lecture 24; so we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption must be incorrect. ∎\n\nii.\n\nreturn isInAuplusB("0" + w)\n\niii.\n\nreturn isInComplementAuplusB("1" + w)\n\niv.\n\nProof: We want to show that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE and that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ RE. We know from part 2 that this means LD ∈ RE. But, we know LD ∉ RE; thus, we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE.\n\nAssume also for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from part 3 that this means that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from the definition of co-RE that if ATM ∈ co-RE, ATM ∈ RE. Since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, then ATM is decidable.

Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules’ behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe emergence and nature of intelligence within computational systems have long been subjects of fascination and rigorous study in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and theoretical computation. Traditional AI methodologies predominantly involve training models on high-quality datasets inherently imbued with human intelligence—such as natural language corpora, expert-annotated datasets, or data reflecting human cognitive processes (Coleman et al., 2019). This approach operates under the assumption that creating intelligent behavior necessitates exposure to intelligent data sources. In contrast, this paper explores an alternative hypothesis: that intelligence can emerge from modeling simple systems as long as they exhibit complex behaviors, even when the process that generates the data lacks inherent intelligence. To investigate this hypothesis, we utilize Stephen Wolfram’s elementary cellular automata (ECA) as our experimental framework. ECAs are one-dimensional, binary-state, discrete computational systems defined by 256 possible 8-bit rules.

Despite their simple rule-based definitions, certain ECAs produce patterns of significant complexity, making them ideal for examining the relationship between intelligence and complexity. Our methodology involves training separate instances of the GPT-2 language model (Radford et al., 2019) on datasets generated by individual ECAs. The models are tasked with predicting future states of the automata. Following this pretraining phase, we evaluate the models’ “intelligence” by quantifying performance on downstream logical reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. This paper presents an extensive study exploring the relationship between system complexity and the emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs). We discover a positive correlation between the complexity of the ECA rules and the downstream performance of models trained on them, highlighting the role of complexity in fostering intelligent behavior. Surprisingly, we find that models can learn complex solutions when trained on simple rules. Our results point to an optimal complexity level, or “edge of chaos”, conducive to intelligence, where the system is structured yet challenging to predict. These findings enhance our understanding of intelligence in artificial systems and provide a framework for future research focused on the importance of complexity in developing these systems.\n\n2 Background\n\n2.1 Elementary Cellular Automata\n\nCellular automata (CAs) are computational models of complex systems, consisting of a grid of cells that evolve over time based on simple rules. They were first introduced by John von Neumann in the 1940s (von Neumann, 1966). CAs have been widely used to simulate various physical, biological, and computational systems due to their simplicity and ability to produce complex behavior. Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) (Wolfram & Mallinckrodt, 1994) are a type of one-dimensional cellular automaton where each cell has a binary state, and its next state is determined by a simple rule that depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors. There are 256 possible ECA rules, 88 of which are unique after accounting for symmetries (Castillo-Ramirez & Magaña-Chavez, 2023). Notable examples include Rule 110, which has been proven to be Turing complete (Cook, 2009), and Rule 90, which generates the fractal-like Sierpinski triangle. These rules are categorized into four classes based on their behavior when initialized with random conditions: Class I, which evolves to a homogeneous state; Class II, which forms simple periodic structures; Class III, which produces chaotic and aperiodic patterns; and Class IV, which exhibits complex structures (Castillo-Ramirez & Magaña-Chavez, 2023). ECAs are valuable computational models used to explore complex systems and emergent behaviors arising from simple rules. Their usefulness lies in their simplicity and the variety of patterns they can produce, making them ideal for studying pattern formation in computation (Meunier, 2016), physics (Banerjee & Dalui, 2024), and mathematical biology (Rasolonjanahary & Vasiev, 2020). Additionally, ECAs have been utilized in cryptography as a basis of certain security frameworks (Corona-Bermúdez et al., 2022) and in computer science education (Staubitz et al., 2016) to illustrate concepts in algorithms and computational theory. Their ability to model intricate systems with minimal computational resources has made ECAs a popular tool across scientific disciplines.\n\n2.2 Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast datasets (Brown et al., 2020). By leveraging deep learning techniques, these models analyze patterns in language to perform tasks such as translation, summarization, and conversational dialogue (Devlin et al., 2018). Notable examples like OpenAI’s GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics (Achiam et al., 2023). The development of LLMs represents a significant advancement in natural language processing, opening up new possibilities for applications in education, research, and industry (Katz et al., 2023).\n\nIncorporating synthetic data into the training of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to significantly boost their performance. Synthetic data generation enables the creation of large, diverse, and high-quality datasets that may not be readily available in the real world (Anaby-Tavor et al., 2019). By augmenting training data with synthetic examples, models can learn from a broader range of linguistic patterns and rare occurrences, improving their ability to generalize to unseen scenarios (Edunov, 2018). As a result, LLMs trained with synthetic data exhibit enhanced robustness, accuracy, and adaptability across various downstream tasks (Feng et al., 2021).\n\n2.3 Complexity Measures\n\nVarious complexity measures have been proposed to assess the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work, we employ the following measures:\n\n1. Lempel-Ziv Complexity assesses the compressibility of a sequence by counting the number of unique substrings in the sequence (Lempel & Ziv, 1976).\n\n2. Compression Complexity quantifies how effectively a sequence can be compressed using a data compression algorithm such as Zlib.\n\n3. Lyapunov Exponent gauges a system’s sensitivity to initial conditions. Higher Lyapunov exponents indicate that small variations in initial states result in rapidly diverging outcomes. We adopt the method proposed by Wolf (1986) for computing this metric.\n\n4. Krylov Complexity evaluates how information propagates in a system’s Hilbert space, measuring how quickly an operator spans larger regions of the state space over time (Parker et al., 2019).\n\n5. Wolfram Classification categorizes ECA rules into four categories based on behavior and complexity (see Section 2.1).\n\nWhile these measures are correlated with one another, each measures different aspects of complexity. For most analyses, we focus on Lempel-Ziv Complexity and the Wolfram Classification. Additional complexity measures are shown for performance on downstream tasks (Section 5.1).\n\n3 Methodology\n\nIn this study, we systematically investigate the relationship between system complexity and emergent intelligence. This section outlines our methodology, including the steps for data generation and model pretraining. An overview of the training process and task evaluations is provided in Figure 1.\n\n3.1 Data Generation\n\nTo train our models, we simulate a selection of ECA rules. Each simulation generates a sequence of binary vectors, where each vector represents the system’s state at a specific time step. For each sample, we begin with a randomly initialized vector as the automaton’s initial state. The system is then evolved over 1000 time steps by repeatedly applying the chosen ECA rule. This process produces a sequence of binary vectors that capture the evolving dynamics of the ECA over time. To increase the diversity of the training data, we extract random spatiotemporal windows from the full sequences. Specifically, we sample subsequences by selecting random windows of 60 time steps and 100 spatial dimensions from the binary vectors. This method exposes the model to a variety of contexts and state configurations, enhancing its ability to learn the dynamics of the ECA rules and generalize to new sequences. Each training sequence represents a randomly selected segment in space and time of the automaton’s evolution. We train models predicting either 1 or 5 steps in the future, to vary the difficulty of the task.\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Our framework for investigating the link between complexity and intelligence. We pretrain Large Language Models (LLMs) on Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) from different complexity classes using next-token prediction, then evaluate them on downstream reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. We use various measures to analyze the complexity of ECA rules, and quantify the relationship between complexity and downstream performance.\n\n3.2 Training Procedure for GPT-2 Models\n\nWe utilized a modified GPT-2 architecture (Radford et al., 2019) adapted for binary input and output data, enabling it to perform next-token prediction on sequences of binary states. Instead of using a traditional token embedding layer followed by a softmax over a vocabulary, we replaced the token embeddings with a linear projection layer that directly maps binary vectors into the model’s embedding space. The GPT-2 model processes these embeddings to capture temporal dependencies and patterns within the sequences. At the output, we apply a linear projection layer to map the model’s hidden states back to the data dimensionality, generating the prediction for the next state of binary variables at each time step. This adaptation allows the GPT-2 model to handle binary data directly and perform next-token prediction without relying on a predefined vocabulary. This also makes the model deterministic, in line with the deterministic nature of ECAs.\n\n3.3 Pretraining Setup\n\nEach model was pretrained on next-token prediction using data generated from a single ECA rule for up to 10,000 epochs. Early stopping based on validation loss was utilized to prevent overfitting and conserve computational resources. The training data were organized into batches of 64 sequences, each comprising 60 time steps and 100 spatial dimensions. We employed the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate η = 2 × 10⁻⁶ and a weight decay of 0.01. A learning rate scheduler with a linear warm-up over the first 10% of the total steps was implemented to stabilize the initial stages of training and improve convergence rates. After the warm-up phase, we applied cosine annealing to gradually decay the learning rate over the remaining training steps. Gradient accumulation was used to handle larger effective batch sizes within the constraints of GPU memory, allowing us to simulate larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple mini-batches. To prevent exploding gradients, we applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0.\n\n4 Experiments\n\nTo evaluate the emergent intelligence of models trained on cellular automata, we conducted experiments on three downstream tasks: one easy and one hard reasoning task inspired by the Abstraction\n\n4\n\nand Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019), and a challenging chess move prediction task (Ruoss et al., 2024). These tasks were designed to quantify the models’ abilities in reasoning, abstraction, and long-term prediction, thereby assessing the level of intelligence encoded during pretraining on ECA rules of varying complexities. We freeze the layers of the pretrained GPT-2 models and train only the input and output projection layers for downstream tasks to ensure that performance differences reflect the inherent capabilities of the models. Our central hypothesis is that models pretrained on complex rules will exhibit superior performance on downstream tasks compared to those pretrained on simple rules. The inclusion of both easy and hard tasks allows us to observe different performance trends and better understand the relationship between pretraining complexity, task difficulty, and emergent intelligence. The chess move prediction task, in particular, serves as an excellent system to test reasoning due to its inherent complexity and requirement for strategic thinking.\n\n4.1 Downstream Task: Reasoning\n\nWe developed a downstream task inspired by the ARC (Chollet, 2019) to evaluate models’ problem-solving and reasoning abilities. Our approach utilizes sequence completion problems that require the model to infer transformation rules from provided examples and apply them to novel scenarios. The data consists of a fixed number of shapes on a grid. At each time step, any of the following transformations can be applied to each shape: changing the color, rotating the shape by 90◦, or shifting the shapes by one position. We designed two versions of the reasoning task, differing in complexity based on the number and type of transformations applied.\n\nEasy In the easy task, we only use 3 × 3 squares that are fixed in position and orientation. The only possible transformation is a color change, which we perform in a predetermined order.\n\nHard The hard task involves more complex patterns where all transformations are applied simultaneously. We used four distinct base shapes, each represented by a 5 × 5 matrix. This results in complex sequences where shapes change color, orientation, and position over time. The combination of these transformations requires the model to reason over multiple simultaneous changes to accurately predict the next pattern in the sequence.\n\nData Preparation and Training on the Downstream Tasks For the easy reasoning task, models were trained for 1,000 epochs with a learning rate of 1 × 10⁻⁴. For the hard reasoning task, due to its increased complexity and difficulty, we post-trained for 10,000 epochs with a learning rate of 1 × 10⁻⁵. Early stopping based on validation loss was again used to prevent overfitting.\n\n4.2 Downstream Task: Chess Move Prediction\n\nFor the chess experiment, we evaluated the capability of the different ECA-pretrained models to predict next moves in chess games represented using Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) (Alg). We use chess games from the Lichess Elite database (Lic), focusing on games played between January and April 2016 by Grandmasters with ratings of 2200 and above. Each game was represented as a sequence of SAN moves. We split this collection into training, validation, and test sets using an 80-10-10 split to facilitate model training and evaluation. Each game sequence was segmented into subsequences of 60 moves each, and any subsequence shorter than this length was padded to length 60. We added an embedding layer to convert the SAN tokens into vector representations, which were then processed using the frozen ECA-pretrained model. A linear output layer was used to transform the outputs to the vocabulary size corresponding to the SAN tokens. These input and output layers were trained while the rest of the model was frozen. The model was trained using cross-entropy loss, the Adam optimizer (Kingma, 2014), and a learning rate scheduler with warm-up. Early stopping was also implemented.\n\n5\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between downstream task performance and rule complexity. Left: Eight representative ECA rules, two from each of Wolfram’s four complexity classes. Performance of models trained on these rules is highlighted in the top row. Top: Model performance in relation to the Lempel-Ziv complexity of each rule. The left and center panels show efficiency (1 divided by number of epochs to reach 80% validation accuracy) for the easy and hard reasoning tasks, respectively. The right panel shows move prediction accuracy for the chess task. The rules depicted on the left are highlighted in the plot with triangles and annotated with the rule number. The correlation coefficient is shown in the top-left corner of each plot. An asterisk next to the value indicates a significant relationship (p < 0.05). Bottom: Downstream task performance based on Wolfram classification of each rule. Models trained on chaotic and complex rules perform better than models trained on uniform and simple rules.\n\n4.3 Hardware and Software\n\nThe experiments were conducted using PyTorch version 2.1.2 and the Transformers library (version 4.41.0), with CUDA version 12.4 for GPU acceleration. The models were trained on 12 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, each with 80 GB of memory, running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8.\n\n5 Results\n\nIn this section, we present our results exploring the relationship between system complexity and emergent intelligence in LLMs. The following sections detail our analyses of task performance and attention patterns across models trained on varying rule complexities.\n\n5.1 Relationship between Intelligence and Complexity\n\nFigure 2 presents the model performance across three downstream tasks (easy reasoning, hard reasoning, and chess move prediction) as a function of the complexity of the ECA rules the models were pretrained on. The top row highlights the relationship between performance and the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the rules, while the bottom row categorizes the performance by Wolfram’s complexity classes. For clarity, two representative rules from each complexity class are displayed on the left, with their corresponding performance annotated in the top plots. For the reasoning tasks, models generally achieve near-perfect accuracy when trained for sufficient long time. Therefore, instead of reporting absolute accuracy, we focus on model efficiency, defined as the inverse of the number of epochs required to reach 80% accuracy. The chess task is sufficiently difficult that models do not achieve perfect performance, and so we report the final accuracy. As rule complexity increases, we observe a clear positive correlation in all tasks, with\n\n6\n\n50 100 150 200 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008\n\nEfficiency r=0.75 * Compression Complexity\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 r=0.51 * Lyapunov Exponent\n\n0 25 50 75 100 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 r=0.74 * Krylov Complexity\n\n50 100 150 200 0.0001 0.0002 0.0003 0.0004 0.0005 0.0006 0.0007\n\nEfficiency r=0.40 *\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.0001 0.0002 0.0003 0.0004 0.0005 0.0006 0.0007 r=0.04\n\n0 25 50 75 100 0.0001 0.0002 0.0003 0.0004 0.0005 0.0006 0.0007 r=0.59 *\n\n50 100 150 200 Complexity 0.180 0.185 0.190 0.195 0.200 0.205\n\nAccuracy r=0.43 *\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 Complexity 0.180 0.185 0.190 0.195 0.200 0.205 r=0.27\n\n0 25 50 75 100 Complexity 0.180 0.185 0.190 0.195 0.200 0.205 r=0.54 * Reasoning (ARC Easy) Reasoning (ARC Hard) Chess Move Prediction\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between downstream task performance and rule complexity for other complexity measures. Rows depict easy reasoning, hard reasoning, and chess move prediction tasks, while columns show compression complexity, Lyapunov exponent, and Krylov complexity, respectively. We observe the same general patterns that we see with the Lempel-Ziv complexity in Figure 2.\n\nmore complex rules leading to greater efficiency. This correlation is significant for each of the tasks (p < 0.05). In terms of Wolfram’s classification, rules from Classes I and II (uniform and periodic) show lower average efficiency in the reasoning tasks compared to those from Classes III and IV (chaotic and complex). Complex rules especially outperform the other classes on the chess move prediction task. This pattern suggests that models trained on more complex rules tend to perform better on harder downstream tasks. Results with respect to other complexity measures are shown in Figure 3. We observe that models trained on certain Class III (Chaotic) rules, such as Rules 105, 146, and 150, have poorer performance on the hard reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. This behavior is expected due to chaotic systems lacking the structured patterns necessary for effective learning. In other words, they may be too random to predict, leading to weaker downstream performance. These results highlight the existence of a “sweet spot” of complexity conducive to intelligence, where the system is still predictable yet hard to predict.\n\n5.2 Models Learn Complex Solutions For Simple Rules\n\nThe elementary cellular automata (ECA) are inherently memoryless, meaning the state at the next time point is determined only by the current time point, without any consideration of past states. For each model, a straightforward solution exists: simply learning the 8-bit ECA rule and applying it to the current state to predict the next state. However, alternative solutions may also be possible, where the model leverages historical states for its predictions. The key question is whether the model is merely learning the trivial solution or if it is integrating information from the state history.\n\n7\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 168 (Uniform)\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 179 (Periodic)\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 22 (Chaotic)\n\nt-10\n\nt-5\n\nt Rule 110 (Complex)\n\nt-10 t-9 t-8 t-7 t-6 t-5 t-4 t-3 t-2 t-1 State 10⁻² 10⁻¹ Attention Score Rule 168 Rule 179 Rule 22 Rule 110\n\n20 40 60 80 100 Complexity (Lempel-Ziv) 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 Average Attention On Last 10 States r=0.66*\n\nTo explore this, we analyze the self-attention scores with respect to the last state in the input sequence, which the model uses to predict the next state (see Section 3.2). Specifically, we examine the attention values corresponding to the final ten states before the target state. Figure 4 illustrates the average attention across all layers and heads for the different ECA rules, as well as the attention at each of the last 10 states for one rule from each complexity class. Our findings reveal that models trained on rules that produce more complex dynamics tend to allocate higher attention to the last ten states, with a strong positive correlation (r=0.66) between rule complexity and average attention. This suggests that models trained on complex rules integrate information from past states to make their predictions. In contrast, models trained on simpler rules display lower attention across the last ten states. For example, Rule 168 (uniform) shows consistently low attention, indicating that previous states are not being utilized in the prediction process. Rule 179 (periodic) demonstrates a recurring pattern in its attention scores, where the model focuses on every other state. This behavior is expected by the nature of Rule 179, which produces an alternating pattern that repeats every two time steps (Figure 4). Thus, the model appears to be learning only this alternating cycle, rather than general state history. The simpler attention structure suggests that these models learn a trivial solution, which is in line with their downstream performance. We emphasize that for both simple and complex rules, a trivial solution exists: learning the 8-bit instantaneous rule and applying it to only the current state. Such a model would have no attention on previous states, as it only needs the current state to make its prediction. The fact that the complex models are attending to previous states indicates that they are learning a more complex solution to this simple problem, and we conjecture that this complexity is what makes the model “intelligent” and capable of repurposing learned reasoning to downstream tasks. We had initially expected that predicting one step in the future would be too easy, and would result in every model learning the trivial (8-bit rule) solution. As such, we trained models to predict 5 steps ahead.\n\nSurprisingly, we found that models predicting only the next step not only learned non-trivial solutions, but even outperformed models predicting five steps ahead (Figure 5). This result suggests that even when predicting the immediate next state, the models are learning nontrivial solutions (provided that the underlying rule is complex), capable of capturing complex patterns beyond the trivial rule-based approach.\n\nFigure 4: Attention scores for the final 10 states prior to the target state, showing that models trained on more complex rules rely more heavily on past states for prediction. Left: Visualization of the last 10 states and the target state for representative rules from each of Wolfram’s complexity classes. Center: Attention scores for each of the last 10 states, highlighting that models trained on complex and chaotic rules focus more on recent states, while models trained on uniform rules exhibit consistently low attention. Periodic rules demonstrate a repeating attention pattern, suggesting that the model is learning to attend to earlier cycles of the same state rather than general state history. Right: Average attention across the final 10 states for all rules, plotted against Lempel-Ziv complexity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.66) indicates that models trained on higher complexity rules attend more highly to historical states during prediction.\n\nFigure 5: Performance comparison between models trained on short-term and long-term prediction tasks. Each point represents an ECA rule, with the x-axis showing the performance of models trained on short-term (1-step) prediction and the y-axis showing performance of models trained on long-term (5-step) prediction. The points are colored by the Lempel-Ziv complexity of each rule. The dashed line represents equal performance between the two models. Points below the line indicate better performance for short-term prediction models.\n\nIn this section, we explored the relationship between system complexity and emergent intelligence. Our results show that downstream model performance improves with pretraining on more complex rules, but can deteriorate with excessive complexity or chaotic behavior, signifying a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. Attention patterns further reveal that models trained on complex rules integrate historical information into their predictions, suggesting that they are learning more sophisticated solutions to relatively simple problems. We hypothesize that this complexity in the learned representations is a key factor enabling models to generalize and perform well on downstream tasks.\n\nRelated Work\n\nElementary Cellular Automata and Complexity Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) serve as foundational models for exploring complexity arising from simple rules. Early research demonstrated that even minimalistic CA systems, governed by basic and local interaction rules, could generate intricate patterns over time (Wolfram, 1983). Wolfram’s extensive investigations into one-dimensional CA revealed that certain rules produce behaviors ranging from stable and periodic to chaotic and complex (Wolfram, 1984). In his work Cellular Automata and Complexity, Wolfram classified one-dimensional CA into four classes based on their dynamic behaviors, highlighting the rich complexity that simple systems can exhibit (Wolfram & Mallinckrodt, 1994).\n\nComputation at the Edge of Chaos The concept of computation at the “edge of chaos” suggests that systems poised between order and disorder exhibit maximal computational capabilities and complex behavior. Langton (1990) introduced this idea, demonstrating that cellular automata operating at this critical transition can perform complex computations. Packard (1988) explored how systems adapt toward the edge of chaos, suggesting that evolution may favor systems that balance between stability and chaos. Mitchell et al. (1993) investigated evolving cellular automata to perform computations, finding that rules near the edge of chaos are more capable of complex tasks. These studies provide a theoretical foundation for our work, as we observe that models trained on rules with higher complexity exhibit greater intelligence in downstream tasks.	2024-12-29 13:57:28.556127	2024-12-29 13:57:28.556129	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-2410.02536v2-9003", "chunks_count": 16}

This occurs most densely in Lolita’s Foreword, which is a collage of possible readerly postures. Caught in Nabokov’s web, it is easy to forget that many of those postures, such as the desire for social workers and educators to be more vigilant protectors of children, are reasonable and easy to accept. But it is John Ray Jr’s prosaicness, his banal moral position, which dissolves in contact with Lolita. As proof of that moral dissolution, to John, Lolita is a “tempest in a test tube,” a demonstration of an act more than 12% of adult American males “enjoy yearly,” and whose author, had he come in contact with a competent psychopathologist, would have caused no disaster. So we understand early that this John’s position is absurd; we even see it quickly compromised when he suffices to say that Humbert is “abnormal” and “not a gentleman” before praising “how majestically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author.” With this front-loaded guide on how to not read the book—to merely abhor the author while delighting in his gorgeous aesthetics—Nabokov does not simply separate aesthetics from morality, nor does he only problematize aesthetics as something potentially obfuscatory towards proper morals. Instead, he is laying the groundwork for a morality that does not contain aesthetics, but is re and co-defined by its two-way relationship with aesthetics. This we see most clearly stated on page 283 of Lolita, when Humbert says:\n\n“Unless it can be proven to me… that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. To quote an old poet: ‘The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.’”\n\nEarly in Pnin, Professor Pnin is having a stroke of sorts in a park of Whitchurch, on his way to deliver a speech in Cremona. Nabokov jokes, via his narrator, that Pnin’s sensation of sliding back to his own childhood is what a veteran psychoanalyst might explain as re-experiencing one’s baptism. But what we are shown as the “explosion of intervening recollection” seems to be nothing less than an alternate explanation to the ridiculous psychoanalytic one of Pnin’s stroke, or panic attacks—that is, the origin of Pnin’s anxiety, which manifests throughout the novel. We are told at the beginning of Pnin’s recollection that everything started with a strange chill that pervaded his body, but it’s unclear if this an actual fever chill, since his mother, who is described as a frail, nervous little person, simply looks at his temperature with stupefaction. She calls the doctor, but only after the doctor leaves—in fact, “no sooner had the doctor left” than she and a servant girl wrap poor Timofey in soaked linen, absorbent cotton, and sticky, diabolical oilcloth, the hue of urine and fever. Indeed, we’re told that these were of no avail against the branching chill of his ribs. If we envision a scenario in which sad, studying Pnin has been victimized by his mother’s anxiety of chills by being wrapped in this horrible cocoon, then the subsequent scene of aesthetic birth, in which he tries to find the key to the pattern of life in the flowers he is restricted to stare at takes on significance not as idiosyncratic fever but very real trauma. The anxious association and strength of this trauma is only magnified on page 24, when it is the “sense of being late for some appointment as odiously exact as school, dinner, or bedtime” which “added the discomfort of awkward haste to the difficulties of a quest that was grading into delirium.” It is then, in this seemingly unbearable moment, that the foliage of the flowers detaches, loses its flatness, and dissolves into a form of aesthetic bliss. And thus adult Pnin, in the park having a panic attack about missing his presentation, at every turn being thwarted by incorrect schedules and poorly placed papers, is thrust back to the source of the trauma which caused his anxiety, and his aesthetics, to germinate.\n\nPnin’s pathological fear of pneumonia is linked with his panic attacks, as in the park he immediately worries of pneumonia, and throughout the novel repeatedly and insistently focuses on the hearty American drafts, the wind, the cold, and the electric heaters.\n\nIn other words, morals are the tax we pay to legitimize and enable our aesthetic appreciation. Though the co-definition of morals and aesthetics in Lolita is not nearly so simple, that subtle act of reconstituting moral goodness appears also in the afterword, when Nabokov identifies the purpose of fiction to be aesthetic bliss, which allows connection with other states of artistic being, where curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy are nurtured. But if this gives us some vague, somewhat unstable picture of how morals might be defined as a compassionate dilution of aesthetic objectification, how do we reverse the definition — in Nabokov’s world, what defines aesthetics, and do they have a metaphysics?\n\nRichard Rorty takes direct issue with Nabokov’s aesthetics. He argues that Nabokov insightfully, if not originally, identifies psychological associations and personal history as the origin of our moral and aesthetic behavior. He sees these Freudian idiosyncratic origins as temporal and individual, and therefore not the grounds for the higher bliss Nabokov maintains as vital to fiction. But this supposed temporality, I think, is what Nabokov cleverly erodes in Pnin, allowing him to trace aesthetics in a more complex and transcendent manner.\n\nVia this superficially silly story one is reminded of Marcel Proust, of that legendary author’s debilitating and surely terrifying bouts of severe asthma, and of his at least partially autobiographical childhood character in the first volume of In Search of Lost Time. In that volume, Marcel’s overwhelming and inescapable nervous pathology leads him to cloister himself in his room, waiting for a good night kiss from his mother and, in his anxious isolation and general inability to play outside, weaving fantastic stories from the lamplight on the wall. Proust’s father was a neurologist who specialized in nervous disorders and believed Proust to have a mental abnormality of neurasthenia rather than his severe, breath-stealing asthma; thus we have the picture of two characters, little Marcel and poor Pnin, who, traumatized by an incomprehensible system which smashed against the restrictive moral and medical allowances of their childhood, birthed an aesthetic sense which punctures subsequent time.\n\nDespite the horrors of adult Humbert, one must not forget to be empathetic towards the brutal reality of childhood Humbert’s experience losing his first, and by some definitions only, true love. Though Humbert’s couching of his loss in Poe’s poem creates an air of aestheticized falsity, late in the novel, when he realizes “the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised–the great rosegray never-to-be-had,” are we only tricked by Humbert, or is there a shred of truth? And one cannot forget that his experiences with Annabelle were constantly limited by the social realities permitted by their caretakers—perhaps we can say Humbert’s constant obsession with the transgressive is a scintillation between a desire to securely satisfy and utterly destroy the societal norms which, in combination with typhus, ensured the rosegray could never be had. After all, Humbert says he was “perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for.” Here, the demoniac is not only the nymphophilic monstrosity it becomes, but, unrecognized by Humbert, also a misanthropic loathing of societal rules, compressed by his experiences with childhood sexuality, which incubates in his uniquely sociopathic mind to become his awful crime.\n\nSimilarly, in order for Pnin to “exist rationally,” he must not remember Mira Belochkin, because that memory coincides with a sense of diffusion and dilation within his chest which the narrator identifies early with death. Like all of these characters, Pnin experiences the moment where the mind remembers an otherworldly tragedy: “no conscience, and hence no consciousness, could be expected to subsist in a world where such things as Mira’s death were possible.” And this tightness in Pnin’s chest, this dissolutive experience, articulates on the page with the narrator’s description of Gramineev’s easel. This moment is for Pnin, like for Proust, and for Humbert, the result of an atemporal rupture in the supposedly transcendent metaphysics of prevailing moral systems, a trauma which was lodged in consciousness and yet disallows all consciousness, and which is the birthplace of Nabokov’s aesthetic tingle. Because as readers we know what it is impossible for the narrator to see — that the two dark figures on the easel, silhouettes in profile against the ember-red sky, are not the Poroshin girl and her beau, or Nina Bolotov and young Poroshin; they are Pnin, and Mira.	2024-12-29 14:02:02.569512	2024-12-29 14:02:02.569514	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-final presentation-6452", "chunks_count": 6}

Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price – the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk.\n\nBonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds.\n\nInvestors consider U.S. Treasury bonds to be free of default risk. In other words, investors believe that there is no chance that the U.S. government will default on interest and principal payments on the bonds it issues. For the remainder of this article, we will use U.S. Treasury bonds in our examples, thereby eliminating credit risk from the discussion.\n\nCalculating a Bond's Yield and Price To understand how interest rates affect a bond's price, you must understand the concept of yield. While there are several different types of yield calculations, for the purposes of this article, we will use the yield to maturity (YTM) calculation. A bond's YTM is simply the discount rate that can be used to make the present value of all of a bond's cash flows equal to its price.\n\nIn other words, a bond's price is the sum of the present value of each cash flow, wherein the present value of each cash flow is calculated using the same discount factor. This discount factor is the yield. When a bond's yield rises, by definition, its price falls, and when a bond's yield falls, by definition, its price increases.\n\nA Bond's Relative Yield The maturity or term of a bond largely affects its yield. To understand this statement, you must understand what is known as the yield curve. The yield curve represents the YTM of a class of bonds (in this case, U.S. Treasury bonds).\n\nIn most interest rate environments, the longer the term to maturity, the higher the yield will be. This makes intuitive sense because the longer the period of time before cash flow is received, the greater the chance is that the required discount rate (or yield) will move higher.\n\nInflation Expectations Determine the Investor's Yield Requirements Inflation is a bond's worst enemy. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a bond's future cash flows. Typically, bonds are fixed-rate investments. If inflation is increasing (or rising prices), the return on a bond is reduced in real terms, meaning adjusted for inflation. For example, if a bond pays a 4% yield and inflation is 3%, the bond's real rate of return is 1%.\n\nIn other words, the higher the current rate of inflation and the higher the (expected) future rates of inflation, the higher the yields will rise across the yield curve, as investors will demand a higher yield to compensate for inflation risk.\n\nNote that Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) can be an effective way to offset inflation risk while providing a real rate of return guaranteed by the U.S. government. As a result, TIPS can be used to help battle inflation within an investment portfolio.\n\nShort-Term, Long-Term Interest Rates, and Inflation Expectations Inflation and expectations of future inflation are a function of the dynamics between short-term and long-term interest rates. Worldwide, short-term interest rates are administered by nations' central banks. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets the federal funds rate. Historically, other dollar-denominated short-term interest rates, such as LIBOR or LIBID, have been highly correlated with the fed funds rate.\n\nThe FOMC administers the fed funds rate to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting economic growth while maintaining price stability. This is not an easy task for the FOMC; there is always debate about the appropriate fed funds level, and the market forms its own opinions on how well the FOMC is doing.\n\nCentral banks do not control long-term interest rates. Market forces (supply and demand) determine equilibrium pricing for long-term bonds, which set long-term interest rates. If the bond market believes that the FOMC has set the fed funds rate too low, expectations of future inflation increase, which means long-term interest rates increase relative to short-term interest rates – the yield curve steepens.\n\nIf the market believes that the FOMC has set the fed funds rate too high, the opposite happens, and long-term interest rates decrease relative to short-term interest rates – the yield curve flattens.\n\nThe Timing of a Bond's Cash Flows and Interest Rates The timing of a bond's cash flows is important. This includes the bond's term to maturity. If market participants believe that there is higher inflation on the horizon, interest rates and bond yields will rise (and prices will decrease) to compensate for the loss of the purchasing power of future cash flows. Bonds with the longest cash flows will see their yields rise and prices fall the most.\n\nThis should be intuitive if you think about a present value calculation – when you change the discount rate used on a stream of future cash flows, the longer until cash flow is received, the more its present value is affected. The bond market has a measure of price change relative to interest rate changes; this important bond metric is known as duration.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Nominal Rates and Real Rates?\n\nNominal interest rates are the stated rates, while real rates adjust for inflation. Real rates provide a more accurate picture of borrowing costs and investment returns by accounting for the erosion of purchasing power. 10\n\nWhy Do Bond Prices and Interest Rates Have an Inverse Relationship? Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, newly issued bonds offer higher yields, making existing lower-yielding bonds less attractive, which decreases their prices.\n\nWhy Is the Yield Curve Important? The yield curve illustrates the relationship between bond yields and their maturities. A normal curve slopes upward, indicating higher yields for longer maturities. Inverted or flat curves can signal economic uncertainty or impending recession. This curve helps shape communicate future expectations about global economies.\n\nHow Can Investors Safeguard Their Portfolios Against Interest Rate and Inflation Fluctuations? Investors can diversify their portfolios to include assets like stocks, commodities, and inflation-protected securities to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes and inflation on their investments. If you're specifically interested in hedging your investment portfolio against high or increasing interest rates, consider discussing this investment decision with your financial advisor.\n\nThe Bottom Line Interest rates, bond yields (prices), and inflation expectations correlate with one another. Movements in short-term interest rates, as dictated by a nation's central bank, will affect different bonds with different terms to maturity differently, depending on the market's expectations of future levels of inflation.\n\nThe key to understanding how a change in interest rates will affect a certain bond's price and yield is to recognize where on the yield curve that bond lies (the short end or the long end) and to understand the dynamics between short- and long-term interest rates. With this knowledge, you can use different measures of duration and convexity to become a seasoned bond market investor.	2024-12-30 09:20:16.231646	2024-12-30 09:20:16.231647	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Interest Rates, Bond Yields, and Inflation-7969", "chunks_count": 4}

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nSuddenly the king cried to Snowmane, and the horse sprang away. Behind him, his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.	2024-12-30 09:22:45.783102	2024-12-30 09:22:45.783105	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-The Ride of the Rohirrim-1190", "chunks_count": 2}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others, to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in time of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation—\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;\n\nFor protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;\n\nFor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;\n\nFor imposing taxes on us, without our consent;\n\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;\n\nFor transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;\n\nFor abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;\n\nFor taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments;\n\nFor suspending our own legislature and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice, and of consanguinity. We must therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in general congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states they may have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\n\nThe foregoing declaration was, by order of Congress, engrossed, and signed by the following members:\n\n— JOHN HANCOCK\n\nNew Hampshire Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\nMassachusetts Bay Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island Stephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\nConnecticut Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\nNew York William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\nMaryland Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Chas.

Queueing delay is 9ms because packet 1 finished sending at t=61ms and packet 2 arrives at the router at t=52ms.\n\nPropagation Delay: (l = distance, c = light speed in that medium) (seconds) t l  =   l c\n\nin cable c  =  2 × 10 8  m/s Serialization delay: t p  =   size of packet link rate (bits per second)   =   p r Total time to send a packet across a link: t  =  t p  +  t l  =    p r    +   l c Queueing delay if the link is busy (a packet needs to wait in line at the FIFO queue).

(Not a single router, or chromecast) Say two flows share 10 Mbits/s. Then, it could possibly be:\n- 5 Mbit/s + 5 Mbit/s\n- 2.5 Mbit/s + 7.5 Mbit/s\n- 0 Mbit/s + 10 Mbit/s\n- 0 Mbit/s + 5 Mbit/s (this is a collapse)\n- 0 Mbit/s + 10 Mbit/s but every packet is sent twice (throughput 10 Mbit/s but “goodput” 5 Mbit/s, this is also a collapse)\n- Easiest approach of flow-control: window_size.\n- We could have both: 1) receiver’s window and 2) “congestion window”. The minimum of the two cap the actual window.\n- “Self-clocking”: a new byte is sent only after a byte is acked (or judged lost)\n- Wrong window size is okay (see below), but wrong rate would lead to more dangerous situations (e.g. queue overflow).\n- How much data can be “on the link”?\n- The BDP (Bottleneck link rate Delay Product): RTT * link rate\n- The ideal value for window size for one flow\n- If the window size is greater than BDP, packets queue up at routers. (At the steady state, window size - BDP bytes is queued at the bottleneck, not so bad).\n- If the window size is smaller than BDP, the bottleneck link may be idle. (Some part of the link would be wasted, but still not so bad)\n- With one flow, BDP is the ideal window. Any window less than BDP + max queue size is “no loss” window.\n- Say two flows share 10 Mbits/s and RTT = 100ms.\n- One flow, good window ~ 10 Mbit/s * 100ms = 1 Mbit = 100 kByte\n- Two flow, good window: 50 kByte for each flow\n- BUT, the “ideal” window is unknown at runtime. How to approximate the right congestion window without knowing: RTT, bottleneck link rate, and number of flows\n\nOne important note is that:\n\n"... all routers support per-flow round robin (RR) queuing on the outgoing links and have sufficient buffer to never cause drops (packet loss)."\n\nThis may be helpful:\n\n"At the bottleneck router, buffer will begin to build up for each flow. However, once this becomes sufficiently large (W-BDP), the sender will send additional packets only on receiving ACKs, which will be received at the bottleneck throughput. Given this and that each router implements round-robin queueing, the worst off flow’s throughput will be maximized (since all flows at the bottleneck link get equal share of the link). Therefore, this system converges to max-min fairness."\n\nThis is how I see it:\n\nThe general story is that the queue for each flow will eventually be full. As it starts to empty, the senders will only be able to send more when they receive ACKs. Because B and C are sharing the 10 Mbit/s link with round robin, they will get an even number of ACKs. Because they get an even number of ACKs they will end up sharing the link equally. Because C is only using 5 Mbit/s of the X to Y link, A will take advantage of the remaining capacity.\n\n5 KEYS FOR TCP SOCKET: Destination Port, Source Port, Destination Address, Source Address, Protocol\n\n2 Conditions collapse: doesn’t do duplicate work and queue never drains empty (should always be doing work)\nInfer loss by: timeout OR duplicate acknowledgements\nDroptail threshold = The number of bytes where the queue starts dropping packets.\n\nReferencing the example from lecture, assuming steps 1, 2, 4 are complete, if you're A, then you've already had your FIN ACKed, so your sender is inactive. Also, you've received B's FIN, so your receiver is inactive. However, you don't know if B has received your ACK that you've received B's FIN, so you need to still linger. This is the case where sender and receiver are inactive but you're still lingering. If you wait for a while (linger) and don't get a retransmission of B's last packet with FIN and ACK of your FIN, then you can assume they got your ACK of their FIN, and stop lingering.	2024-12-30 10:48:44.615802	2024-12-30 10:48:44.615804	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-CS 144 Cheatsheet - Google Docs-9806", "chunks_count": 5}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others, to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in time of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation—\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;\n\nFor protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;\n\nFor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;\n\nFor imposing taxes on us, without our consent;\n\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;\n\nFor transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;\n\nFor abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;\n\nFor taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments;\n\nFor suspending our own legislature and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice, and of consanguinity. We must therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in general congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states they may have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\n\nThe foregoing declaration was, by order of Congress, engrossed, and signed by the following members:\n\n— JOHN HANCOCK\n\nNew Hampshire Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\nMassachusetts Bay Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island Stephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\nConnecticut Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\nNew York William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\nMaryland Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Chas.

You’ll submit that separately. Some notation you might want for this problem set:\n\n• The encoding of an object can be denoted ⟨M⟩. • The complement of a language is denoted L<sup>c</sup>. • You can represent different classes of languages as R, RE, co-RE, P, and NP.\n\nProblem One: This Program is Not Responding\n\nThere is no program the OS could run which could determine for sure for all programs if they are causing/will cause an infinite loop, or if they’re just running for a long time. If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language. - checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square. - checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers. - checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square. - checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.\n\nThe verifier halts on all inputs because it’s given a certificate  n  which specifies how many steps  M  should take to return a result for  w .  <  M,w  >∈ ATM  only when there is a number of steps  n  which  M  takes to accept  w; if there was no number of steps, then  M  would loop infinitely, so we would not know if  <  M,w  > was in  ATM, and if  M  didn’t loop infinitely on  w, then there would be a number of steps  n  it took.\n\nProblem Three: Isn’t Everything Undecidable? i.\n\nIt breaks down at "This is impossible." The proof does not explain why it is impossible for  trickster(w)  to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L. In fact,  trickster  is defined exactly to return false if and only if  w  ∈ L, so it is behaving as expected.\n\nii.\n\nThis is wrong when it says "Since  willAccept  decides  L  and  me  holds the source code of  trickster, we know that  willAccept(me,input)  returns  true  if and only if  trickster(input)  returns  true." That is wrong because there’s nothing about  trickster(input)  that influences whether  willAccept(me,input)  would return true. That if and only if only applied in the  ATM  case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language  L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how  trickster  is written, we see that  isValid(me)  returns true if and only if  trickster  is not syntactically valid. This assumes that if  isValid  returns false, then in the else statement, having valid syntax means  trickster  has valid syntax. However,  trickster  has invalid syntax even if we branch into the  else  condition because invalid syntax doesn’t rely on which lines of the program get run; just having incorrect syntax earlier in the program makes it invalid even if the else condition is valid.\n\nProblem Four: Double Verification\n\nbool isInL(string w): − for (each string c) −− if checkInL(w, c) return true −− if checkInLBar(w, c) return false\n\nCS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Fall 2024\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 9 December 5, 2024\n\nProblem Six: co-RE and Beyond i.\n\nProof: We want to prove that ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know that ATM is recognizable; that is, for any word w ∈ Σ*, there exists a recognizer M which accepts w if and only if w ∈ ATM. Since ATM ∈ co-RE, we know for any w ∈ ATM that there exists a recognizer W which accepts w if and only if w ∉ ATM. Thus, since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, ATM is decidable, since a language is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are recognizable. However, ATM is not decidable, as proven by self-reference in Lecture 24; so we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption must be incorrect. ∎\n\nii.\n\nreturn isInAuplusB("0" + w)\n\niii.\n\nreturn isInComplementAuplusB("1" + w)\n\niv.\n\nProof: We want to show that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE and that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ RE. We know from part 2 that this means LD ∈ RE. But, we know LD ∉ RE; thus, we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE.\n\nAssume also for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from part 3 that this means that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from the definition of co-RE that if ATM ∈ co-RE, ATM ∈ RE. Since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, then ATM is decidable. However, we know ATM is not decidable. Thus we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE.\n\nOptional Fun Problem: Undecidability Phase Transitions\n\nWrite your answer to the Optional Fun Problem here.\n\nGrand Challenge Problem: P ?= NP\n\nWrite your response to the Grand Challenge Problem here.\n\nCongratulations on finishing the last problem set of the quarter!\n\nCS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Fall 2024	2024-12-31 13:04:05.908634	2024-12-31 13:04:05.908635	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-CS_103_HW_9-8221", "chunks_count": 4}

Since w ∈ X, there exists a language L such that w ∈ L and L ⊆ f(L). By the earlier result we know that L ⊆ X and since f is monotone, it follows that f(L) ⊆ f(X). Therefore, we see that since w ∈ L, L ⊆ f(L), and f(L) ⊆ f(X), w ∈ f(X) as required.\n\nNow, we want to prove f(X) ⊆ X. We can first see that since X ⊆ f(X) and f is monotone implies that f(X) ⊆ f(f(X)). Therefore, based on our above, we know that f(X) ⊆ X as required.\n\nProblem Three: Unstarring a Language\n\ni.\n\n3 is the only codeword.\n\nii.\n\n1. {}\n2. {a, b}\n3. {ab, ba, aa, bb}\n4. {b, ba, baa}\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 8 November 24, 2024\n\niii.\n\nProof: Let M be a monoid over the alphabet P. We want to show that (M unstar)* ⊆ M and M ⊆ (M unstar)*.\n\nFirst, we will show that (M unstar)* ⊆ M. Take any element m ∈ M unstar. m is a codeword in M, meaning m ∈ M. So, M unstar ⊆ M. Then, by our proof in Problem Set Six Problem 6 Part IV, we know that since M unstar ⊆ M, (M unstar)* ⊆ M, which is what we wanted to show.\n\nNext, we will show that M ⊆ (M unstar)*. Let P(n) be the statement "for any string w ∈ M where |w| = n, w ∈ (M unstar)*. We will prove by induction that P(n) holds for all n ∈ N from which the theorem follows.\n\nAs our first base case, we prove P(0), that for any string w ∈ M where |w| = 0, that string can be written as a concatenation of codewords. In this case, w ∈ M where |w| = 0 is ϵ. We know ϵ ∈ (M unstar)* because the Kleene star of any set contains ϵ.\n\nAs our second base case, we prove P(1), that for any string w ∈ M where |w| = 1, w ∈ (M unstar)*. In this case, w ∈ M by construction, w ≠ ϵ, and because |w| = 1, any two x and y where xy = w requires one of x or y to be ϵ. Therefore, w is a codeword.\n\nFor our inductive step, pick some k ∈ N and assume that P(0), P(1), ..., and P(k) are true. Pick some w ∈ M where |w| = k + 1. There are two cases: Case 1: w is a codeword. Then w ∈ (M unstar), and therefore by the definition of *, w ∈ (M unstar)*. Case 2: w is not a codeword. Therefore, there exist x, y ∈ M such that w = xy and x ≠ ϵ and y ≠ ϵ. Since x and y have length > 0 and w = xy, both x and y must have length less than k + 1, and so, by the IH, each can be written as a concatenation of codewords. Therefore, w = xy is also in (M unstar)* since w can be written as a concatenation of two strings from (M unstar)*.\n\nThis completes the induction, showing M ⊆ (M unstar)*. ■\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 8 November 24, 2024\n\nProblem Five: Executable Computability Theory\n\ni.\n\n• It is the recognizer for L = {a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup> | n ∈ N}\n• Yes decider\n• Decidable\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 8 November 24, 2024\n\nii.\n\n• It is the recognizer for L = Σ* • Yes decider • Decidable\n\niii.\n\n• It is the recognizer for L = {w ∈ Σ* | |w| is a Fibonacci number} • Not decider • Decidable\n\nProblem Six: Timing Attacks\n\ni.\n\n79 steps.\n\nProblem Seven: What Does it Mean to Solve a Problem?\n\ni.\n\nstart return false\n\nii.\n\nstart return true\n\niii.\n\nstart GoTo start\n\niv.\n\nWe want to show that M is a decider for L.

The very Self of all creatures is Mahesvara, one, whose form is all, full of the undivided consciousness “this”. The one, full of the ‘savouring’ (camatkara) of the undivided perceiving subject, of the undivided perceptible object and of the fusion of the two, in the fourth state which is to be sought first, the Self common to all living beings, whose form is all, is Mahesvara. — 1 —\n\n2. There (tatra), realities such as the mind etc., which are included in the sphere of the ‘this’ freely created [by the Lord] (svasrstedambhage), are caused by him to be considered as the fictitious I (ahamkara) as being the perceiving subject. This universe springing forth as constituted by the free expansion (jrmbha) of the supreme Lord, realities that are created as the object\n\n1 The translation refers to the most immediate and general meaning of the text of the kârikâ. The far more complex explanation given by the vrtti depends on considering the two terms of the expression aham idam first separately and then together. 2 The above note has already mentioned how this interpretation has been arrived at. As Abh. explains (see text note 2), we have here the reflective awareness of the perceiving subject as not distinct from the other subjects, i.e. of the fundamental unity of the subject beneath the apparent fragmentation; the same applies to the object; and finally the awareness of the ultimate non-otherness (melana) of subject and object. 3 Because starting from this the maculation begins to dissolve (see text note 1). 4 The text, which remains doubtful, seems to contain a double interpretation (tantra) of tatra in the kârikâ (which I have translated in a deliberately vague manner): mahesvarasya jrmblmmaye ’smin nirgate and tasminn idantâparâmarse. This would coincide with the brief references in IPVV III p. 358 to the fikâ, which evidently gave this type of interpretation: tatra iti vaiyadhikaranyena vivrtya sâmâ- nâdhikaranyena vivrnoti (i.e. tatra taken alone or agreeing with °blwge). Abh. in his two commentaries also follows the line of the simultaneous double function of tatra, which he refers in both cases to Mahesvara: ‘Mahesvara being the self, the part ‘this’ is created by him upon a substratum constituted by himself’ (thus in the first case\n\n210\n\nof perception - the mind, the breath, the void - in the sphere of the IV reflective awareness ‘this’, precisely these realities, which represent a part of the knowable, are caused to be considered as the fictitious I and are, on the strength of this, transformed into the limited perceiving subject.\n\n3. The individual subjects considered as being many are the fruit of the non-recognition of their true nature. In them action and beatitude are created, that is, the fruition characterized by pleasure and pain. It is precisely the rendering limited of that whose essence is all which is called ‘non-recognition’. And thus the awareness of a limited subjectivity attributed to multiple and fragmented realities, such as the mind, the breath and so on, is called absence of the perfect knowledge of the supreme subjectivity. The individual selves are many; in them - who are manifested as knowing subjects - Mahešvara creates his own beatitude and activity, which are themselves inherent in the only real agency. This is precisely the fruition which is called pleasure, since it consists in a particle of [divine] beatitude, and pain, since it is an infinitesimal fragment of [divine] activity. The fact that activity is pain will be explained later.\n\n4. In the limited subject sattva, rajas and tamas correspond to knowledge, activity, and, thirdly, may a, in the Lord - for whom things represent his own body (svaiigarupesuj).\n\ntatra is a locative absolute with sati understood, in the second, it is a locative depending on svasṛṣṭa). 5 The capacity for fruition that the Lord instills in the various limited souls is therefore a reflection created by him of the powers of beatitude and activity, which are, on the contrary, innate in him. They are therefore kalpita. Beatitude and activity are not a different thing from jñāna and kriyāśakti, prakāśa and vimarśa (IPVV III p. 359). 6 Abh. explains this point (ibid. p. 360) by using the example of a long serpent (gonāsa), whose body is pervaded by a single life (jīvaḥ), capable, however, of being divided into many distinct partial vitalities which animate the individual parts of the same serpent when it is cut into pieces; and also capable of becoming one again. 7 The power of māyā is that which on the Sadāśiva-Īśvara plane determines the appearance of idamta within the consciousness (IPVV III p. 361). It is a further expansion of kriyāśakti; indeed, in Abh.’s words (ibid. p. 366), it is the kriyāśakti itself in which, however, instead of samhāraṇa predominating (śakti predominates in jñānaśakti) śānyatā or niṣedha predominates, i.e. the mutual delimitation of subject\n\n211\n\nIV 4 - The knowledge and activity of the Lord, together with māyā, become sattva, rajas and tamas in the limited subject. - 4 -\n\n5. Owing to the state of differentiation, these qualities (guṇānām), which are transformed in the faculties and in the products, cannot be considered as powers inherent in a subject who is the possessor of them*. Since sattva, rajas and tamas are manifested as distinct [from the subject], the term powers may not be applied to them, in that there is no differentiation between the power and the possessor of the power. In actual fact everything is an expansion of the power(s)⁹. - 5 -\n\n6. In the Lord there is being, beatitude, activity. In the limited subject there is that, the absence of that and the two together¹⁰. The latter constitute rajas, which is pain and is composed of sattva and tamas intermixed. - In the Lord, the infinite agency, whose essence is ‘savouring’ (camatkāra), is called activity and consists of supreme light and beatitude¹¹.\n\nand object. This power does belong to Siva but, as the formulation of the karika points out, it is not on the same plane as the powers of knowledge and action, since it is connected with differentiation (cf. ibid. p. 361). 8 This karika is intended to be a reply to those who want to take the parallel between knowledge, activity, and maya, on the one hand, and sattva, rajas, and tamas on the other, too far, by considering the latter ‘powers’ of the limited subject just as the former are powers of Siva. Utp. replies that this cannot be so, because the limited subject looks on them – and on all the deployment of phenomena that evolves from them and is imbued with them – as other than himself, whereas the power is by definition not separate from the subject who possesses it. In the limited subject knowledge (prakafa) etc. are not spontaneous (naisargikya) and autonomous functions, but require the contribution of other factors – e.g. the senses – in order to be performed, which are all penetrated by and derived from the gunas. This is why they are called gunas, i.e. ‘qualities, components’, but also ‘subordinate, auxiliary elements’ (cf. IPVV 111 p. 362). 9 What has been said so far is only valid, however, within the limits of the world of differentiation. Once the subject recognizes his own true nature, the objective world ceases to appear in the guise of alterity and it is then that all the principles become what they effectively are, his ‘powers’. 10 What is referred to here, as the vrtti makes clear, is the guna rajas, constituted by the presence of sattva as prakasa-ananda (the guna sattva) and by its (their) absence (the guna tamas). 11 These qualities of the Lord are involved with one another and in the final analysis are identified with one another (cf. IPV II p. 289 ya sattva bhavanakartrta\n\n212\n\nOn the contrary, in the individual self this light and beatitude, which have IV 6 become knowable realities, constitute sattva. Their absence is tamas. Sattvva and tamas – or light-beatitude and their absence – though two distinct entities, are mutually united to form rajas. In the limited subject activity and pain are called rajas. – 6 –\n\n7. Those realities which in the Lord are the object of an unconventional reflective awareness in terms of ‘this’, those, mixed and separated, are thus manifested in various ways12. The things that constitute this universe (ye caite), which are to Mahesvara—as in the case of the child—indicated by the meaning of the word ‘this’ (reflective awareness being the very essence of the light), without the connection with [or: the consideration of] the conventional linguistic expression ‘this’ coming into play13, those very things appear—since they were created thus by God—as particular realities (svalaksana°) thanks to several manifestations having the same substratum (°sdmanddhi-karanyena) and in many forms insofar as they are universals each taken singly14. 7—\n\n8. On the contrary, in the individual subject15, those entities that are manifested separately become the object of mental elaboration in the\n\nsphurattarupa ... saiva ... camatkararupa sail kriyaSaktir ucyate ... svatmaviSrantiru-pat\\fac ca saiva anandah). In the pasu the guna sattva corresponds to the satta and ananda aspect in the Lord. 12 ‘On the plane of the limited subject’ is understood. 13 Some form of paramarsa is inseparable from the pure light of cognition, as reflective awareness reactive to it, an act of appropriation on the part of the I. On this level, on which the ‘this’ is conceived purely and simply as a negation of the I (IPVV p. 367), things are the object of paramarta only in terms of ‘this’, without any other differentiations. And furthermore it is specified that this paramarsa is also free from any contact with the conventional linguistic expression ‘this’, since the word—which is, as we know, inseparable from it—is still at a level transcending every articulated language, similar rather to a silent nod of the head. An example that clarifies this is the dim and undifferentiated awareness of (and reaction to) what is other than itself and that surrounds it, that the newborn child is presumed to have. 14 See the following karika. 15 Karika 7 has defined the status of the object in relation to the Lord. But Abh. (IPVV III p. 367) makes it clear that it is not the supreme Lord in this case, since at the level of Paramasiva one cannot speak of any objectivity whatsoever, this only beginning to emerge when he assumes the nature of Sadasiva and Isvara (indeed the\n\n213\n\nIV. 8. sphere of memory, imagination and so on, and have a variety of distinct names. The entities that are manifested separately, that is, the universals, are shown by the limited subjects—thanks to the power of mental elaboration (vikalpanasaktya)—as the object of inner reflective awareness through various names such as ‘jar’, ‘silvery’, ‘white’, ‘cloth’, ‘cart’ and so on. The limited subjects, conditioned by the experience of these objects, then also make themselves the object of various denotations such as ‘I am thin’, ‘I am happy or unhappy’. In memory this function of mental elaboration takes place in the wake of the previous direct experience; in the various forms of imagination etc. it is, on the contrary, autonomous. It is precisely this manifestation of a differentiation between perceiving subject and object perceived, substantiated by the word, which constitutes the bond of the samsara in the limited soul.\n\n9-10. The creation that pertains to him is not also common [to other subjects] and is dependent on the creation of the Lord. It occurs in the limited subject—essentially identical to the Lord—in virtue of the very\n\nplane of the Lord (pati°, Isvaradasâ) corresponds to these). Kârikâ 8 expounds how the object appears on the plane of limited subjectivity. Of the two kinds of object, particular (svalaksana) and universal (sâmânya), only the latter (cf. text note 16) is taken into consideration here, because the word, which in this kârikâ is shown as that which accompanies and renders possible discursive thought, has as its content precisely the sâmânya, i.e. the âbhâsa taken separately (see above II. 3. 2). Vikalpana is, as has been seen, that characteristic function of discursive thought that proceeds to define the object through the evocation and negation of what is other than it. In this the essential role is played by the word, as the Buddhists show by the conception of the apoha. See above I. 8. 1 ff. Many saiva texts insist on the fundamental ambivalence of the word, which permeates every level of human activity. The powers of the word, often conceived as the powers that preside over the various alphabetical classes, may lead man to freedom or enmesh him even more in the samsara. To remain within the terms of the discourse of the vrtti, they may increase the dichotomies of the vikalpa but they may also, if correctly polarized, gradually re-absorb the vikalpa in pure reflective awareness - pure insofar as it is not dualizing (the two possible ways of overcoming the vikalpa will be dealt with at some length later). IPVV III pp. 379-380 refers to some of the classical passages of these speculations with quotations from the SK, the Timirodghâta (the explicit attribution to this text is contained in SSV p. 7) and the MV, to which the SS, at least, can be added.\n\npower of the Lord, ignored, however, as such, which aims at preventing the resting on the self, unstable, whose nature is vital energy, diversified in the multiplicity of the various phonemes, coinciding with the activity of mental elaboration (Vikalpakriyaya). The individual subject, whose nature is identical to that of the Lord, creates, thanks to the power of the Lord not recognized as such, objects in the form of the various universals, not perceptible on the part of the other subjects and modelled on the direct experience of objects that may be experienced by everyone. And this power of the Lord, aimed at obstructing the resting on authentic subjectivity, takes the name of maya; it contains the infinite number of all the various phonemes - K etc. -, it is continuously in motion in the form of vital energy, it carries out the function called ‘mental elaboration’. In this way it creates the objects internally.\n\n11. The creation of the Lord may be common or not common to all subjects (sadharano ’nyatha ca), manifesting itself in both cases in all clarity. With the suppression of the mental constructs, resulting from concentration on a single point, the plane of the Lord is gradually reached.\n\n20 As we saw earlier, also the limited subject possesses an innate power of creation which is in essence no different from that of the Lord, since the individual himself is essentially identical to the Lord although he ignores or has forgotten this identity. This power of creation, limited by non-awareness, remains restricted to the individual sphere: what is created are images, feelings, ideas, etc., which depend more (as in the case of memory) or less (as in fantasy) on the objects in the phenomenal world created by the Lord. These two kinds of objects and of creations are distinguished by being the last ‘common to all subjects’, the others are ‘not common’, i.e. not able to be experienced except by the limited subject who creates them. But the power of creation is essentially the same. 21 The object of the mental elaboration (vikalpa etc.) is not the svalakṣaṇa, but the samanya, which is not attached to a definite time and place. 22 Or: ‘...becomes the object of the reflective awareness [‘I am this universe’] peculiar to the condition of Isvara’. The creation of the Lord is therefore twofold. On the one hand it constitutes the world of objective existence, regarding which all subjects are coordinated; on the other - restricted to a single individual - it constitutes the sphere of dream and error, such as the mistaken sight of two moons, which as far as clarity and immediacy are concerned is on the same plane as the other (cf. III. 2. 16); cf. IPVV III p. 386 aiwarasya sargasya spasṭavabhāsatvam, ata eva avikalpyateti rūpam. This interpretation of the first part of the kārikā and in particular of the expression ścīdhrāṇo ’nyathā ca is that suggested by the vrtti, but not the only possible one. For instance, one may understand, as appears from the\n\n215\n\nfika, ‘the creation of the Lord, common or not common, is different (from the creation of the limited subject)’, in which asadharana (‘not common’) is implied by the conjunction ca. To this Abh. adds an interpretation of his own (IPVV III p. 386 and IPV II pp. 301-2): if the creation pertaining to the limited subject, or the creation of the vikalpas, assumes full vividness being experienced differently – i.e. recognizing the power of the Lord in it –, then it too becomes common, i.e. able to be experienced by everyone, as in the case of he who, being imbued with the energy of the mantras, becomes able to transform his representations and intentions into reality; in this case the pasavah sargah, too, can lead to the condition of the Lord (svaratam asya dadati). As he himself explains, the aitah sargah of the karika may be understood as pasavah sargah, insofar as also this latter form of creation rests, in its ultimate essence, on the former; if this interpretation is not directly referred to in the vrtti and fika – Abh. adds – it is only because the ultimate identity of the pasava and aisvara creation is too obvious to be stated overtly. 23 In the sense that the creation of the object is parallel to that of the subject. Reality, in effect, is constituted by the interaction of determinate levels of subjectivity with the corresponding levels of objectivity (see e.g. PH pp. 6-7). 24 The absence of the split between subject and objective reality constitutes the cardinal difference between Isvara’s creation and the pasu's creation (IPVV III p. 388 ‘bhedanudayat’ iti / anena aisvarasya sargasya patavat sargat vailaksanyam darsitam; see also II p. 329); and it is precisely for this reason that the creation of the Lord does not represent a bond. However, it must be considered, Abh. continues (ibid.), that in the pasu's creation two levels may be distinguished, and whereas the first only shows the emergence of differentiation, with the mayic and danava maculations, it is the second, presided over by Brahma (cf. III. 2. 1) and consisting in the various psychic and mental activities (pratyaya), that directly causes the karmic maculation and binds to the samsara. 25 Dharmakirti defines the type of knowledge that pertains to the yogins in similar terms: PV III. 281 praguktam yoginam jnanam tesam tadbhavandmayam / vidhutakalpandjalam spasiam evavabhasate; see also PVin I.\n\n28 and the following passage in prose (Steinkellner 1972: 203). 26 I.e., the vikalpa.\n\nIV 11  - On the contrary, the creation of the Lord is common to all cognizing subjects - since they are born within it23 - or also limited to only one subject like that which is manifested in dream, in error and so on, where it concerns a single subject. Permeated only by the reflective awareness of ‘I am this universe’, this creation of the Lord is free from mental constructs (vikalpojjhita) - since no differentiation arises within it24 - and it is manifested in all clarity (spastavabhasa ca)25. On this plane, by applying oneself and intensely cultivating those moments when the mental construct becomes attenuated, which occur sporadically (antarantara) while the activity26 pertaining to the limited subject is taking place, the beings in the power of the samsara gradually attain, through\n\n216\n\nthe emergence of the state of the Lord in all its fullness, the dissolution IV 11 of the state of limited individuality. - 1 1 -\n\n12. He who, having all as his essence, thus knows: «All this multiform deployment is mine», he, even in the flow of mental constructs, attains the state of Mahesa21. - Also the individual subject who - though continuing to produce mental constructs deriving precisely from the power of the Lord - has become fully aware of his own nature as Lord - ‘Mine is this multiform deployment of the samsara’ - this subject, too, who permeates the universe without any differentiation and transforms all the mental constructs into pure reflective awareness, attains the state of Mahesvara.\n\n- 12 -\n\n13. The liberated soul looks at the common cognizable reality as being undifferentiated from himself, like Mahesvara; the bound soul, on the contrary, looks at it as absolutely differentiated. - Cognizable reality28 is the same for the bound and the liberated soul; however, the bound soul knows it as absolutely differentiated and the liberated soul as the body of his very self. - 13 —\n\n14. But when he is completely full of the infinite series of principles dissolved in him, he is Siva, solely consciousness and bliss, having as his body the supreme syllable29. - But when the cognizable is entirely dissolved within him and there is the full consciousness of the I, the state of Siva is attained. - 14 -\n\n27 This is an alternative path to that expounded in the previous karika; both are directed to the same aim which is to free from the bond of the vikalpas. In the first the vikalpas were gradually suppressed by fixing the ninnkalpa (cf. PH pp. 39-40; IPVV III p. 386 avikalpakaparigrhltaspastavastuvisayaikagratavalambanena); here, on the contrary, their inclusion and transfiguration in the sphere of the totality of consciousness is taught. 28 I.e. the so-called objective reality (cf. IV.11) facing both the liberated soul and the bound soul. 29 Unlike the situation expounded in the previous karika, where the cognizable subsisted though in a state of non-differentiation with the I—a state that Abh. compares to that of the plane of Sadasiva-Isvara—, here one cannot even speak of cognizable reality, as it has now been dissolved and absorbed in the I without a trace. This is the state of the supreme Siva.\n\n217\n\nIV 15 15. Thus seeing the true reality of what is his own self and the knowledge and action that pertain to him, he knows and creates objects as he wishes. Having thus recognized as Lord his own self full of the infinite powers of knowledge and action once the signs of recognition represented by the powers have come to light, he sees and creates all things at will. — 15 —\n\n\n16. Thus this new, easy path has been explained by me as the great master expounded it in the Sivadrsti. Thus he who, putting his feet on it, brings to light in the self the nature of creator of the universe whose essence is the nature of Siva, and is uninterruptedly absorbed in it, attains perfection. Within the course of ordinary reality, in its various forms, solely in virtue of an act of recognition (pratyabhijhamdtrdt) is the state of Siva attained. This new path, devoid of tortuosity, was indicated in the treatise that bears the name of Sivadrsti by the venerable Somananda, who had direct experience of the form of the blessed Paramesvara; I have here furnished a logical justification of this path, thus causing it to enter the hearts of men. He who by applying himself intensely to this enters into the nature of Siva, becomes in this very life a liberated soul. — 16 —\n\n17. Just like the beloved, who, after much insistence, finally stands in the presence of the maid in love, though he is there before her, he does not give her any pleasure until she recognizes who he is—as he seems just like other men until that moment—, so for mankind the self, who is yet the Lord of the world, cannot manifest his own glory until his qualities have been brought to light. For this reason, the doctrine of the recognition of the Lord has here been expounded. The example of the beloved shows that the recognition of the Lord must be awakened30 and that its fruit is extraordinary. — 17 —\n\n30 Utp. uses the causative form of the root upapad-, as he has done before, in his oscillation between the meanings of ‘awaken’, ‘render possible’, and ‘justify logically’ (cf. also the following kārikā).\n\n18. In order that the ordinary man too can attain perfection (siddhi) IV 18 effortlessly, Utpala, son of Udayakara, has explained with argumentations (upapadita) this recognition of the Lord. This easy path to perfection has thus been shown. — 18 —\n\nHere ends the Isvarapratyabhijñāvṛtti.	2024-12-31 16:30:17.763983	2024-12-31 16:30:17.763984	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-The Ishvarapratyabhijnakarika of Utpaladeva selections-5025", "chunks_count": 14}

You’ll submit that separately. Some notation you might want for this problem set:\n\n• The encoding of an object can be denoted ⟨M⟩. • The complement of a language is denoted L<sup>c</sup>. • You can represent different classes of languages as R, RE, co-RE, P, and NP.\n\nProblem One: This Program is Not Responding\n\nThere is no program the OS could run which could determine for sure for all programs if they are causing/will cause an infinite loop, or if they’re just running for a long time. If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate. - checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language. - checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square. - checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers. - checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square. - checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.\n\nThe verifier halts on all inputs because it’s given a certificate n which specifies how many steps M should take to return a result for w. <M,w>∈ ATM only when there is a number of steps n which M takes to accept w; if there was no number of steps, then M would loop infinitely, so we would not know if <M,w> was in ATM, and if M didn’t loop infinitely on w, then there would be a number of steps n it took.\n\nProblem Three: Isn’t Everything Undecidable? i.\n\nIt breaks down at "This is impossible." The proof does not explain why it is impossible for trickster(w) to return false if and only if w ∈ L. In fact, trickster is defined exactly to return false if and only if w ∈ L, so it is behaving as expected.\n\nii.\n\nThis is wrong when it says "Since willAccept decides L and me holds the source code of trickster, we know that willAccept(me,input) returns true if and only if trickster(input) returns true." That is wrong because there’s nothing about trickster(input) that influences whether willAccept(me,input) would return true. That if and only if only applied in the ATM case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how trickster is written, we see that isValid(me) returns true if and only if trickster is not syntactically valid. This assumes that if isValid returns false, then in the else statement, having valid syntax means trickster has valid syntax. However, trickster has invalid syntax even if we branch into the else condition because invalid syntax doesn’t rely on which lines of the program get run; just having incorrect syntax earlier in the program makes it invalid even if the else condition is valid.\n\nProblem Four: Double Verification\n\nbool isInL(string w): − for (each string c) −− if checkInL(w, c) return true −− if checkInLBar(w, c) return false\n\nCS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Fall 2024\n\nJaiden Reddy, David Lu Problem Set 9 December 5, 2024\n\nProblem Six: co-RE and Beyond i.\n\nProof: We want to prove that ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know that ATM is recognizable; that is, for any word w ∈ Σ*, there exists a recognizer M which accepts w if and only if w ∈ ATM. Since ATM ∈ co-RE, we know for any w ∈ ATM that there exists a recognizer W which accepts w if and only if w ∉ ATM. Thus, since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, ATM is decidable, since a language is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are recognizable. However, ATM is not decidable, as proven by self-reference in Lecture 24; so we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption must be incorrect. ∎\n\nii.\n\nreturn isInAuplusB("0" + w)\n\niii.\n\nreturn isInComplementAuplusB("1" + w)\n\niv.\n\nProof: We want to show that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE and that LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE. Assume for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ RE. We know from part 2 that this means LD ∈ RE. But, we know LD ∉ RE; thus, we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ RE.\n\nAssume also for the sake of contradiction that LD ⊍ ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from part 3 that this means that ATM ∈ co-RE. We know from the definition of co-RE that if ATM ∈ co-RE, ATM ∈ RE. Since both ATM and ATM are recognizable, then ATM is decidable. However, we know ATM is not decidable. Thus we have reached a contradiction, and LD ⊍ ATM ∉ co-RE.\n\nOptional Fun Problem: Undecidability Phase Transitions\n\nWrite your answer to the Optional Fun Problem here.\n\nGrand Challenge Problem: P ?= NP\n\nWrite your response to the Grand Challenge Problem here.\n\nCongratulations on finishing the last problem set of the quarter!\n\nCS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Fall 2024	2024-12-31 18:15:44.595178	2024-12-31 18:15:44.59518	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-CS_103_HW_9-0828", "chunks_count": 4}

First, I’ll propose a system for understanding the work based partially on mathematics, and then I’ll apply that system to the enigmatic character. In explaining my system, I’m going to take quite a bit of latitude, but I promise it will return satisfyingly to the text, so bear with me.\n\nIn literature, we often speak about projection, which is a polyvalent word simultaneously recalling Freudian psychology and, among other evocations, the flat presentation of images on a surface. In mathematics, projection has its own, rigorously defined meaning. It is a function which takes as input a high-dimensional space and returns as output a lower-dimensional space. A plane may become a point, a cube may become a plane, a hyper-dimensional figure may return to three dimensions. In short, an input is compressed into a lower-dimensional state where it may more easily be computed, interpreted, and re-interpreted.\n\nHowever, as a rule, projection cannot be undone without information about the original not contained solely in the function’s output. One might immediately think of Plato’s cave—from the shadow alone, without knowledge of the world there is no hope of recomputing the world which creates the shadow. When we view puppets on a screen, we know there is no mechanism by which the child viewer can recreate the puppet from their shadow—the creepy button eyes, the worn skin, the players behind the mask—unless the child themselves is a puppeteer.\n\nSuch is the unique problem and the unique capability of literature as a technology. The process of writing, we might say, is a projection downwards, the satisfaction of a weighty and unstable internal emotion condensed into the single prismatic metaphor which, by nature of the word unit, has a lower dimension than a more literal explanation of that emotion. However, in reading, one is challenged to interpret the polyvalent metaphor, unprojecting it back into the multidimensional space from which it came, and thereby recovering, reproducing, or displacing, the original projected object.\n\nIn mathematics, the process of unprojection can only occur via an agreed-upon code between the producer and user of a specific instantiation of that process. If we have not read Macbeth, tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow replanted in a new text cannot recover its existential despair and thus a dimension has been lost. So as students of literature we are intuitively comfortable with not only the presence of a compact between author and reader by which unprojection may occur but also with the constant instability of that compact. Of course, some might argue, as Paul De Man does in Autobiography as Defacement, that all reading involves writing and all writing involves reading—the instability of unprojection implies the continuous individual creation and prediction of the code which the author must perform when they imagine what the reader will understand and which the reader must perform when they imagine what the author might have meant. And thus, via a lengthy introduction, we have reached our novel, and Nabokov.\n\nNabokov’s predecessors were well-versed in the process of compressing the object into the image, and even, at least as early as in Jane Eyre, with the decompressive step, through the miscues and hilarious mistellings which happen anytime an unreliable consciousness is both reader and writer, as we all are in the world. However, Nabokov makes explicit this second decompressive step, separating one consciousness into two, which he does not do in Lolita, and which enables something far more unique.\n\nI argue that the technological innovation of this work lies not in the original tale, the depressing relationship between two relentlessly neurotic men, nor the attempt to read Kinbote in his entirety, wherein we must interpret an interpretation and end up caught in Nabokov’s vast web. Nabokov does not need, or perhaps even expect, us to interpret Kinbote into an even higher dimensional space. Rather, separating the two consciousnesses enables the reader to analyze the interpretive functions themselves, the solar flare by which the puppet of Shade’s life becomes the shadow of his poem, and the reflection of that flare, Kinbote’s pale, lunar luminescence in the window, just visible in its snowy, doubled realm, by whose light the shadow has been unprojected back into the world and become something else entirely.\n\nThis understanding of *Pale Fire* helps us illuminate the enigmatic Gradus. Gradus is a character full of contradictions. During the commentary Kinbote mocks him relentlessly, designating him into a shadowy mirror role, where he is a clockwork man re-experiencing Charles’s fantastical journey, but without any of the whimsy or queerness or humanity and therefore only as a leering joke. However, we notice that in many ways the story of Gradus is the complement rather than the mocking retelling of Charles’s story. We know from the Index entry about Charles II (page 306) that Charles travels from the palace to the port, then through Paris, then through Switzerland, visits Villa Disa, and then finally arrives in America—but other than both ends of this journey, and his brief visit to Villa Disa, we see nothing of this journey except through the eyes of Gradus. And there is evidence his visit to that Villa is nothing more than a dream. On page 206, Charles’s entry into Villa Disa has him simply appear in garlands of shade; soon after on page 210 he describes his dreams of her as both awfully tender, constantly aware of her helpless love for him, and haunted by a confession of his, perhaps to homosexuality. Her begging for him to stay on page 213, which includes the offer for him to “bed here as many as forty guests, forty Arabian thieves,” satisfies both dream requirements. And he says on the bottom of 211 that these dreams are finished by his seeing a faint smile of hers in the corner of his eye, but turning to find her not to be there. Indeed, the Villa Disa sequence closes on page 214 with his vision of her as a white figure bending over the garden table, when a “fragile bridge was suspended between waking indifference and dream-love,” only to realize that it was not her at all, but Fleur.\n\nAll this to say that it is Kinbote’s telling of Gradus that creates Charles’s own journey from Zembla to America, excluding the actual sections in Zembla and America. At the bottom of page 177, we find out briefly and in parentheses only in a Gradus section that Charles had reclined on that Parisian sofa where Gradus currently sits; later, at the bottom of page 200, we find “The King was here” scrawled in charcoal in the lavender villa Gradus both sullies and, perhaps, creates.\n\nAnd thus, is there Zemblan King Charles without Gradus? Is there Odon to enable that king’s escape without Nodo to shuffle and deal the fated, cheated card, as he does on page 150, which sends Gradus after the King? Gradus, then, is the structural support which enables Kinbote’s fantasy not only in form and language, as when he slips and slides through caesuras and rhymes, but also in the crucial narrative fiber which allows us to see, and Kinbote therefore to create, his own journey.\n\nThis process-based definition of Gradus recalls Bakhtin’s definition of heroic creation through the loving bestowal of death which Naiman quotes and interprets in his chapter on Hermophobia. Bakhtin says that “memory begins to act as a gathering and completing force from the very first moment of the hero's appearance; the hero is born in this memory (of his death)... in this sense we could say that death is the form of the aesthetic consummation of an individual” (Naiman 116). Shade’s constant preterist tendencies, where he recognizes death in every sloughing moment of his life, builds to this aesthetic consummation, when the *Pale Fire* poem is freed from its earthly container and brought into Kinbote’s arms through Shade’s murder by Gradus.\n\nJust as a function is both the transportation of a specific input to a specific output, it is also a structure and system which exists outside and agnostic of any input and output. So too is Gradus both the key enabler of aesthetic consummation which accompanies each line of the poem, carries its prosaic interpretation, and enables its ultimate apotheotic release, but also is himself a frustrating, common, clockwork mechanism which can only be an enabler and never a participant—as we see on page 154, Gradus points out the right instrument and directs the carving, but never himself takes part in the infernal sacrament.\n\nThis polyvalent role requires Gradus to exist not only as Gradus the function but as d’Argus, Jacques de Grey, and finally Jack Grey, specific narrative instances of our endless Gradus. The tragic madman Jack Grey is allowed to end, as we are told on page 299, in a gesture of humanoid despair, not a feeble splutter of clockwork. But we know from page 301, the end of the novel, that despite poor Jack’s death, our instance’s death is not the function’s death, as no matter Kinbote’s final destination, no matter the manner of his great sob, no matter the conduct of any future unprojection, a bigger, more respectable, and more competent Gradus will be waiting at the door.	2025-01-01 05:40:05.800308	2025-01-01 05:40:05.800309	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-pale fire presentation-2-5299", "chunks_count": 5}

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others, to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in time of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation—\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;\n\nFor protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;\n\nFor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;\n\nFor imposing taxes on us, without our consent;\n\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;\n\nFor transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;\n\nFor abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;\n\nFor taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments;\n\nFor suspending our own legislature and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice, and of consanguinity. We must therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in general congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states they may have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\n\nThe foregoing declaration was, by order of Congress, engrossed, and signed by the following members:\n\n— JOHN HANCOCK\n\nNew Hampshire Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\nMassachusetts Bay Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island Stephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\nConnecticut Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\nNew York William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\nMaryland Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Chas.

Mine is the proverbial office\nwatercooler, where opinions are shared and gossip is exchanged. I hope\nto enrich the vocabulary that people use when they talk about the\njudgments and choices of others, the company's new policies, or a\ncolleague's investment decisions. Why be concerned with gossip?\nBecause it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and\nlabel the mistakes of others than to recognize our own. Questioning what\nwe believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult\nwhen we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions\nof others. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues\nwill evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated\njudgments therefore matters. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a\npowerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year\nresolutions to improve one's decision making at work and at home.\nTo be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of\nlabels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its\nsymptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and\nconsequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness.\nLearning medicine consists in part of learning the language of medicine. A\ndeeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer\nvocabulary than is available in everyday language. The hope for informed\ngossip is that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make.\nSystematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in\nparticular circumstances. When the handsome and confident speaker\nbounds onto the stage, for example, you can anticipate that the audience\nwill judge his comments more favorably than he deserves. The availability\nof a diagnostic label for this bias-the halo effect makes it easier to\nanticipate, recognize, and understand.\nWhen you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally\nanswer. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often\nconsists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But\nthat is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way.\nMost impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without\nyour knowing how they got there. You cannot tracryd>e how you came to\nthe belief that there is a lamp on the desk in front of you, or how you\ndetected a hint of irritation in your spouse's voice on the telephone, or how\nyou managed to avoid a threat on the road before you became consciously\naware of it. The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and\nmany decisions goes on in silence in our mind.\nMuch of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition. However,\nthe focus on error does not denigrate human intelligence, any more than\nthe attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health. Most of us\nare healthy most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are\nappropriate most of the time. As we navigate our lives, we normally allow\nourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence\nwe have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not\nalways. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective\nobserver is more likely to detect our errors than we are.\nSo this is my aim for watercooler conversations: improve the ability to\nidentify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and\neventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to\ndiscuss them. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest\nan intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often\ncause.\n\nOrigins\nThis book presents my current understanding of judgment and decision\nmaking, which has been shaped by psychological discoveries of recent\ndecades. However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I\nasked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the\nDepartment of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Amos\nTversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research-\nindeed, in anything he did so I knew we would have an interesting time.\nMany people who knew Amos thought he was the most intelligent person\nthey had ever met. He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic. He was also\nblessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use\nthem to make a point. There was never a dull moment when Amos was\naround. He was then thirty-two; I was thirty-five.\nAmos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the\nUniversity of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people\ngood intuitive statisticians? We already knew that people are good\nintuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules\nof grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist.\nDo people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics?\nAmos reported that the answer was a qualified yes. We had a lively debate\nin the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better\nanswer.\nAmos and I enjoyed the exchange and concluded that intuitive statistics\nwas an interesting topic and that it would be fun to explore it together. That\nFriday we met for lunch at Café Rimon, the favorite hangout of bohemians\nand professors in Jerusalem, and planned a study of the statistical\nintuitions of sophisticated researchers. We had concluded in the seminar\nthat our own intuitions were deficient. In spite of years of teaching and\nusing statistics, we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of\nstatistical results observed in small samples. Our subjective judgments\nwere biased: we were far too willing to believe research findings based on\ninadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own\nresearch. The goal of our study was to examine whether other researchers\nsuffered from the same affliction.\nWe prepared a survey that included realistic scenarios of statistical\nissues that arise in research. Amos collected the responses of a group of\nexpert participants in a meeting of the Society of Mathematical\nPsychology, including the authors of two statistical textbooks. As expected,\nwe found that our expert colleagues, like us, greatly exaggerated the\nlikelihood that the original result of an experiment would be successfully\nreplicated even with a small sample. They also gave very poor advice to a\nfictitious graduate student about the number of observations she needed\nto collect. Even statisticians were not good intuitive statisticians.\nWhile writing the article that reported these findings, Amos and I\ndiscovered that we enjoyed working together. Amos was always very\nfunny, and in his presence I became funny as well, so we spent hours of\nsolid work in continuous amusement. The pleasure we found in working\ntogether made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for\nperfection when you are never bored. Perhaps most important, we\nchecked our critical weapons at the door. Both Amos and I were critical\nand argumentative, he even more than I, but during the years of our\ncollaboration neither of us ever rejected out of hand anything the other\nsaid. Indeed, one of the great joys I found in the collaboration was that\nAmos frequently saw the point of my vague ideas much more clearly than I\ndid. Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and\nan unfailing sense of direction. I was more intuitive and rooted in the\npsychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas. We were\nsufficiently similar to understand each other easily, and sufficiently different\nto surprise each other. We developed a routine in which we spent much of\nour working days together, often on long walks. For the next fourteen years\nour collaboration was the focus of our lives, and the work we did together\nduring those years was the best either of us ever did.\nWe quickly adopted a practice that we maintained for many years.

In part A. the problem essentially\nasks given there is at least one boy in two children, what is the conditional probability\nthat both children are boys. Part B asks that given one child is a boy, what is the\nconditional probability that the other child is also a boy. For both parts, we need to\nassume that each child is equal likely to be a boy or a girl.\n\nAll-girl world?\nIn a primitive society, every couple prefers to have a baby girl. There is a 50% chance\nthat each child they have is a girl, and the genders of their children are mutually\nindependent. If each couple insists on having more children until they get a girl and once\nthey have a girl they will stop having more children, what will eventually happen to the\nfraction of girls in this society?\nSolution: It was surprising that many interviewees include many who studied\nprobability have the misconception that there will be more girls. Do not let the word\n"prefer" and a wrong intuition misguide you. The fraction of baby girls are driven by\nnature, or at least the X and Y chromosomes, not by the couples' preference. You only\nneed to look at the key information: 50% and independence. Every new-born child has\nequal probability of being a boy or a girl regardless of the gender of any other children.\nSo the fraction of girls born is always 50% and the fractions of girls in the society will\nstay stable at 50%.\n\nUnfair coin\nYou are given 1000 coins. Among them, I coin has heads on both sides. The other 999\ncoins are fair coins. You randomly choose a coin and toss it 10 times. Each time, the\ncoin turns up heads. What is the probability that the coin you choose is the unfair one?\nSolution: This is a classic conditional probability question that uses Bayes' theorem. Let\nA be the event that the chosen coin is the unfair one, then A is the event that the chosen\ncoin is a fair one. Let B be the event that all ten tosses turn up heads. Apply Bayes\ntheorem we have P(A/B) =\nP(B|A)P(A)\nP(B|A)P(A)\nP(B) P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A)P(A)\nThe priors are P(A)=1/1000 and P(A)=999/1000. If the coin is unfair, it always\nturns up heads, so P(B|A) = 1. If the coin is fair, each time it has 1/2 probability turning\nup heads. So P(B|A) = (1/2)¹⁰ = 1/1024. Plug in all the available information and we\nhave the answer:\nP(AB) =\nP(B|A)P(A)\n=\n1/1000×1\nP(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A) P(A) 1/1000×1+999/1000×1/1024\n≈\n0.5.\n\nFair probability from an unfair coin\nIf you have an unfair coin, which may bias toward either heads or tails at an unknown\nprobability, can you generate even odds using this coin?\nSolution: Unlike fair coins, we clearly can not generate even odds with one toss using an\nunfair coin. How about using 2 tosses? Let p₁₄ be the probability the coin will yield\nhead, and py be the probability the coin will yield tails (p₄ + pr=1). Consider two\nindependent tosses. We have four possible outcomes HH, HT, TH and TT with\nprobabilities P(HH) = PHPH P(HT) = PuPc, P(TH) = PrPH, and P(TT) = PrPr\nSo we have P(HT) = P(TH). By assigning HT to winning and TH to losing, we can\ngenerate even odds.\n\nDart game\nJason throws two darts at a dartboard, aiming for the center. The second dart lands\nfarther from the center than the first. If Jason throws a third dart aiming for the center,\nwhat is the probability that the third throw is farther from the center than the first?\nAssume Jason's skillfulness is constant.\nSolution: A standard answer directly applies the conditional probability by enumerating\nall possible outcomes. If we rank the three darts' results from the best (A) to the worst\n(C), there are 6 possible outcomes with equal probability:\n\nI should point out that this simple approach is not the most efficient approach since I am disregarding\nthe cases HH and TT. When the coin has high bias (one side is far more likely than the other side to occur),\nthe method may take many runs to generate one useful result.

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nSuddenly the king cried to Snowmane, and the horse sprang away. Behind him, his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.	2025-01-02 22:20:58.405037	2025-01-02 22:20:58.405039	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-The Ride of the Rohirrim-1747", "chunks_count": 2}

If you are\ndoing the assignment with the class, you can find these files at /data of any non-head node machine.\nIf you are following along at home, you can download these files with the commands inside the README.md.\n2 Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer\nIn the first part of the assignment, we will train and implement a byte-level byte-pair encoding (BPE)\ntokenizer [Sennrich et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2019]. In particular, we will represent arbitrary (Unicode)\nstrings as a sequence of bytes and train our BPE tokenizer on this byte sequence. Later, we will use this\ntokenizer to encode text (a string) into tokens (a sequence of integers) for language modeling.\n2.1 The Unicode Standard\nUnicode is a text encoding standard that maps characters to integer code points. As of Unicode 15.1 (released\nin September 2023), the standard defines 149,813 characters across 161 scripts. For example, the character\n"s" has the code point 115 (typically notated as U+0073, where U+ is a conventional prefix and 0073 is 115 in\nhexadecimal), and the character“牛”has the code point 29275. In Python, you can use the ord() function\nto convert a single Unicode character into its integer representation. The chr() function converts an integer\nUnicode code point into a string with the corresponding character.\n>>> ord('牛')\n29275\n>>> chr (29275)\n'牛' Problem (unicode1): Understanding Unicode (1 point)\n(a) What Unicode character does chr(0) return?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(b) How does this character's string representation (__repr__()) differ from its printed representa-\ntion?\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n(c) What happens when this character occurs in text? It may be helpful to play around with the\nfollowing in your Python interpreter and see if it matches your expectations:\n>>> chr(0)\n>>> print(chr(0))\n>>> "this is a test" + chr(0) + "string"\n>>> print("this is a test" + chr(0) + "string")\nDeliverable: A one-sentence response.\n2.2 Unicode Encodings\nWhile the Unicode standard defines a mapping from characters to code points (integers), it's impractical to\ntrain tokenizers directly on Unicode codepoints, since the vocabulary would be prohibitively large (around\n150K items) and sparse (since many characters are quite rare). Instead, we'll use a Unicode encoding, which\nconverts a Unicode character into a sequence of bytes. The Unicode standard itself defines three encodings:\nUTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, with UTF-8 being the dominant encoding for the Internet (more than 98%\nof all webpages).\nTo encode a Unicode string into UTF-8, we can use the encode() function in Python. To access the\nunderlying byte values for a Python bytes object, we can iterate over it (e.g., call list()). Finally, we can\nuse the decode() function to decode a UTF-8 byte string into a Unicode string.\n>>> test_string = "hello! こんにちは!"\n>>> utf8_encoded = test_string.encode("utf-8")\n>>> print(utf8_encoded)\nb'hello! \\xe3\\x81\\x93\\xe3\\x82\\x93\\xe3\\x81\\xab\\xe3\\x81\\xa1\\xe3\\x81\\xaf!'\n>>> print (type(utf8_encoded))\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> # Get the byte values for the encoded string (integers from 0 to 255).\n>>> list (utf8_encoded)\n[104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33, 32, 227, 129, 147, 227, 130, 147, 227, 129, 171, 227, 129,\n161, 227, 129, 175, 33]\n>>> # One byte does not necessarily correspond to one Unicode character!\n>>> print(len(test_string))\n13\n>>> print (len(utf8_encoded))\n23\n>>> print (utf8_encoded.decode("utf-8"))\nhello! こんにちは!\nBy converting our Unicode codepoints into a sequence of bytes (e.g., via the UTF-8 encoding), we are\nessentially taking a sequence of codepoints (integers in the range 0 to 149,812) and transforming it into a\n3 sequence of byte values (integers in the range 0 to 255). The 256-length byte vocabulary is much more\nmanageable to deal with. When using byte-level tokenization, we do not need to worry about out-of-\nvocabulary tokens, since we know that any input text can be expressed as a sequence of integers from 0 to\n255.\n\nProblem (unicode2): Unicode Encodings (3 points)\n\n(a) What are some reasons to prefer training our tokenizer on UTF-8 encoded bytes, rather than\nUTF-16 or UTF-32? It may be helpful to compare the output of these encodings for various\ninput strings.\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\n\n(b) Consider the following (incorrect) function, which is intended to decode a UTF-8 byte string into\na Unicode string. Why is this function incorrect? Provide an example of an input byte string\nthat yields incorrect results.\n\n```python\ndef decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong (bytestring: bytes):\n    return "".join([bytes([b]).decode("utf-8") for b in bytestring])\n>>> decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong("hello".encode("utf-8"))\n'hello'\n```\nDeliverable: An example input byte string for which decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong pro-\nduces incorrect output, with a one-sentence explanation of why the function is incorrect.\n\n(c) Give a two byte sequence that does not decode to any Unicode character(s).\nDeliverable: An example, with a one-sentence explanation.\n\n2.3 Subword Tokenization\n\nWhile byte-level tokenization can alleviate the out-of-vocabulary issues faced by word-level tokenizers, to-\nkenizing text into bytes results in extremely long input sequences. This slows down model training, since\na sentence with 10 words might only be 10 tokens long in a word-level language model, but could be 50 or\nmore tokens long in a character-level model (depending on the length of the words). Processing these longer\nsequences requires more computation at each step of the model. Furthermore, language modeling on byte\nsequences is difficult because the longer input sequences create long-term dependencies in the data.\nSubword tokenization is a midpoint between word-level tokenizers and byte-level tokenizers. Note that a\nbyte-level tokenizer's vocabulary has 256 entries (byte values are 0 to 225). A subword tokenizer trades-off a\nlarger vocabulary size for better compression of the input byte sequence. For example, if the byte sequence\nb'the' often occurs in our raw text training data, assigning it an entry in the vocabulary would reduce this\n3-token sequence to a single token.\n\nHow do we select these subword units to add to our vocabulary? Sennrich et al. [2016] propose to use\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE; Gage, 1994), a compression algorithm that iteratively replaces (“merges”) the\nmost frequent pair of bytes with a single, new unused index. Note that this algorithm adds subword tokens\nto our vocabulary to maximize the compression of our input sequences if a word occurs in our input text\nenough times, it'll be represented as a single subword unit.\n\nSubword tokenizers with vocabularies constructed via BPE are often called BPE tokenizers. In this\nassignment, we'll implement a byte-level BPE tokenizer, where the vocabulary items are bytes or merged\nsequences of bytes, which give us the best of both worlds in terms of out-of-vocabulary handling and man-\nageable input sequence lengths. The process of constructing the BPE tokenizer vocabulary is known as\n"training" the BPE tokenizer. The BPE tokenizer training procedure consists of three main steps.\n\nVocabulary initialization. The tokenizer vocabulary is a one-to-one mapping from string token to integer\nID. Since we're training a byte-level BPE tokenizer, our initial vocabulary is simply the set of all bytes. Since\nthere are 256 possible byte values, our initial vocabulary is of size 256.\n\nPre-tokenization. Once you have a vocabulary, you could, in principle, count how often bytes occur next\nto each other in your text and begin merging them starting with the most frequent pair of bytes. However,\nthis is quite computationally expensive, since we'd have to go take a full pass over the corpus each time\nwe merge. In addition, directly merging bytes across the corpus may result in tokens that differ only in\npunctuation (e.g., dog! vs. dog.). These tokens would get completely different token IDs, even though they\nare likely to have high semantic similarity (since they differ only in punctuation).\nTo avoid this, we pre-tokenize the corpus. You can think of this as a coarse-grained tokenization over the\ncorpus that helps us count how often pairs of characters appear. For example, the word 'text' might be\na pre-token that appears 10 times. In this case, when we count how often the characters 't' and 'e' appear\nnext to each other, we will see that the word 'text' has 't' and 'e' adjacent and we can increment their count\nby 10 instead of looking through the corpus. Since we're training a byte-level BPE model, each pre-token is\nrepresented as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.\nThe original BPE implementation of Sennrich et al. [2016] pre-tokenizes by simply splitting on whitespace\n(i.e., s.split(" ")). In contrast, we'll use a regex-based pre-tokenizer (used by GPT-2; Radford et al., 2019)\nfrom github.com/openai/tiktoken/pull/234/files:\n>>> PAT = r"""'(?:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+"""\nIt may be useful to interactively split some text with this pre-tokenizer to get a better sense of its\nbehavior:\n>>> # requires `pip install regex\n>>> import regex as re\n>>> re.findall (PAT, "some text that i'll pre-tokenize")\n['some', 'text', ' that', ' i', "'ll", ' pre', '-', 'tokenize']\n\nCompute BPE merges. Now that we've converted our input text into pre-tokens and represented each\npre-token as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, we can compute the BPE merges (i.e., train the BPE tokenizer).\nAt a high level, the BPE algorithm iteratively counts every pair of bytes and identifies the pair with the\nhighest frequency (“A”, “B”). Every occurrence of this most frequent pair (“A”, “B”) is then merged, i.e.,\nreplaced with a new token "AB". This new merged token is added to our vocabulary; as a result, the final\nvocabulary after BPE training is the size of the initial vocabulary (256 in our case), plus the number of BPE\nmerge operations used for training. For efficiency during BPE training, we do not consider pairs that cross\npre-token boundaries.2 When computing merges, deterministically break ties in pair frequency by preferring\nthe lexicographically greater pair. For example, if the pairs ("A”, “B”), (“А”, “C”), (“B”, “ZZ”), and (“BA",\n"A") all have the highest frequency, we'd merge (“BA”, “A”):\n>>> max([("A", "B"), ("A", "C"), ("B", "ZZ"), ("BA", "A")])\n('BA', 'A')\n\n2Note that the original BPE formulation [Sennrich et al., 2016] specifies the inclusion of an end-of-word token. We do not\nadd an end-of-word-token when training byte-level BPE models because all bytes (including whitespace and punctuation) are\nincluded in the model's vocabulary. Since we're explicitly representing spaces and punctuation, the learned BPE merges will\nnaturally reflect these word boundaries. Special tokens. Often, some strings (e.g., <|endoftext|>) are used to encode metadata (e.g., boundaries\nbetween documents). When encoding text, it's often desirable to treat some strings as "special tokens" that\nshould never be split into multiple tokens (i.e., will always be preserved as a single token). For example,\nthe end-of-sequence string <|endoftext|> should always be preserved as a single token (i.e., a single integer\nID), so we know when to stop generating from the language model. These special tokens must be added to\nthe vocabulary, so they have a corresponding fixed token ID.\nAlgorithm 1 of Sennrich et al. [2016] contains a inefficient implementation of BPE tokenizer training\n(essentially following the steps that we outlined above). As a first exercise, it may be useful to implement\nand test this function to test your understanding.\nExample (bpe_example): BPE training example\nHere is a stylized example from Sennrich et al. [2016]. Consider a corpus consisting of the following text\nlow low low low low\nlower lower widest widest widest\nnewest newest newest newest newest newest\nand the vocabulary has a special token <|endoftext|>.\nVocabulary We initialize our vocabulary with our special token <|endoftext|> and the 256 byte\nvalues.\nPre-tokenization When we pretokenize and count, we end up with the frequency table.\n{low: 5, lower: 2, widest: 3, newest:6}\nIt is often convenient to represent this as a dict [tuple [byte]: int], e.g. {(1,0,w):5 ...}\nMerges We first look at every successive pair of bytes and sum the frequency of the words where they\nappear {10: 7, ow: 7, we: 8, er: 2, wi: 3, id: 3, de: 3, es: 9, st: 9, ne: 6, ew: 6}. The pair ('es')\nand ('st') are tied, so we take the lexicographically greater pair, ('st'). We would then merge the\npre-tokens so that we end up with {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,e,st):3, (n,e,w,e,st):6}.\nIn the second round, we see that (e, st) is the most common pair (with a count of 9) and we\nwould merge into {(1,0,w):5, (1,0,w,e,r):2, (w,i,d,est):3, (n,e,w,est):6}. Continuing this, the\nsequence of merges we get in the end will be ['st', 'e st', 'o w', 'l ow', 'w est', 'n e',\n'ne west', 'w i', 'wi d', 'wid est', 'low e', 'lowe r'].\nIf we take 6 merges, we have ['s t', 'e st', 'o w', '1 ow', 'w est', 'n e' and our vocab-\nulary elements would be [<|endoftext|>, [...256 BYTE CHARS], st, est, ow, low, west, ne].\nWith this vocabulary and set of merges, the word newest would tokenize as [ne, west].\nThis naïve implementation of BPE training is slow because for every merge, it iterates over all byte pairs\nto identify the most frequent pair. However, the only pair counts that change after each merge are those\nthat overlap with the merged pair. Thus, BPE training speed can be improved by indexing the counts of\nall pairs and incrementally updating these counts, rather than explicitly iterating over each pair of bytes to\ncount pair frequencies.\nProblem (train_bpe): BPE Tokenizer Training (15 points)\nDeliverable: Write a function that, given path to an input text file, trains a (byte-level) BPE\ntokenizer. Your BPE training function should handle (at least) the following input parameters: input_path: str Path to a text file with BPE tokenizer training data.\nvocab_size: int A non-negative integer that defines the maximum final vocabulary size (including\nthe initial byte vocabulary, vocabulary items produced from merging, and any special tokens).\nspecial_tokens: list[str) A list of strings to add to the vocabulary. These special tokens do not\notherwise affect BPE training.\nYour BPE training function should return the resulting vocabulary and merges:\nvocab: dict[int, bytes] The tokenizer vocabulary, a mapping from int (token ID in the vocabu-\nlary) to bytes (token bytes).\nmerges: list [tuple [bytes, bytes]] A list of BPE merges produced from training. Each list\nitem is a tuple of bytes (<token1>, <token2>), representing that <token1> was merged with\n<token2>. The merges should be ordered by order of creation.\nTo test your BPE training function against our provided tests, you will first need to implement the\ntest adapter at [adapters.run_train_bpe]. Then, run pytest tests/test_train_bpe.py. Your\nimplementation should be able to pass all tests.\n\n2.5 Experimenting with BPE Tokenizer Training\nLet's train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset. Instructions to find / download the dataset\ncan be found in Section 1. Before you start, we recommend taking a look at the TinyStories dataset to get\na sense of what's in the data.\nProblem (train_bpe_tinystories): BPE Training on TinyStories (2 points)\n(a) Train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset, using a maximum vocabulary size\nof 10,000. Make sure to add the TinyStories <|endoftext |> special token to the vocabulary.\nSerialize the resulting vocabulary and merges to disk for further inspection.

What part of the tokenizer training process takes the most time?\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.\nNext, we'll try training a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the OpenWebText dataset. As before, we recom-\nmend taking a look at the dataset to better understand its contents.\nProblem (train_bpe_expts_owt): BPE Training on OpenWebText (2 points)\n(a) Train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the OpenWebText dataset, using a maximum vocabulary\nsize of 32,000. Serialize the resulting vocabulary and merges to disk for further inspection. What\nis the longest token in the vocabulary? Does it make sense?\nResource requirements: < 12 hours (no GPUs), < 100GB RAM\nDeliverable: A one-to-two sentence response. 2.6 ΒΡΕ Tokenizer: Encoding and Decoding\n\nIn the previous part of the assignment, we implemented a function to train a BPE tokenizer on input text\nto obtain a tokenizer vocabulary and a list of BPE merges. Now, we will implement a BPE tokenizer that\nloads a provided vocabulary and list of merges and uses them to encode and decode text to/from token IDs.\n2.6.1 Encoding text\n\nThe process of encoding text by BPE mirrors how we train the BPE vocabulary. There are a few major\nsteps.\nStep 1: Pre-tokenize. We first pre-tokenize the sequence and represent each pre-token as a sequence of\nUTF-8 bytes, just as we did in BPE training. We will be merging these bytes within each pre-token into\nvocabulary elements.\nStep 2: Apply the merges. We then take the sequence of vocabulary element merges created during BPE\ntraining, and apply it to our pre-tokens in the same order of creation.\nExample (bpe_encoding): BPE encoding example\n\nFor example, suppose our input string is 'the cat ate', our vocabulary is {0:\nb' ', 1: b'a',\nb'the', 10: b'\n(b'th', b'e'),\n2: b'c', 3: b'e', 4: b'h', 5: b't', 6: b'th', 7: b'c', 8: b'a', 9:\nat'}, and our learned merges are [(b't', b'h'), (' ', b'c'), (b' ', 'a'),\n(b' a', b't')]. First, our pre-tokenizer would split this string into ['the', 'cat', 'ate'].\nThen, we'll look at each pre-token and apply the BPE merges.\n1\nThe first pre-token 'the' is initially represented as [b't', b'h', b'e']. Looking at our list of\nmerges, we identify the first applicable merge to be (b't', b'h'), and use that the transform the\npre-token into [b'th', b'e']. Then, we go back to the list of merges and identify the next applicable\nmerge to be (b'th', b'e'), which transforms the pre-token into [b'the']. Finally, looking back at\nthe list of merges, we see that there are no more that apply to the string (since the entire pre-token has\nbeen merged into a single token), so we are done applying the BPE merges. The corresponding integer\nsequence is [9].\nRepeating this process for the remaining pre-tokens, we see that the pre-token 'cat' is represented\nas [b'c', b'a', b't'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the integer sequence [7, 1,\n5]. The final pre-token 'ate' is [b' at', b'e'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the\ninteger sequence [10, 3]. Thus, the final result of encoding our input string is [9, 7, 1, 5, 10,\n3].\nSpecial tokens. Your tokenizer should be able to properly handle user-defined special tokens when en-\ncoding text (provided when constructing the tokenizer).\nMemory considerations. Suppose we want to tokenize a large text file that we cannot fit in memory.\nTo efficiently tokenize this large file (or any other stream of data), we need to break it up into manageable\nchunks and process each chunk in-turn, so that the memory complexity is constant as opposed to linear in\nthe size of the text. In doing so, we need to make sure that a token doesn't cross chunk boundaries, else\nwe'll get a different tokenization than the naïve method of tokenizing the entire sequence in-memory.	2025-01-03 11:56:18.297222	2025-01-03 11:56:18.297225	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-cs336_spring2024_assignment1_basics-3817", "chunks_count": 11}

There is no one around and nothing\nin sight except the sand. I, too, am naked, barefoot, dumbfounded\nby everything around me. I can feel the sand under my feet and a\ncool wind. I move slowly toward the bench. When and why has she\ncome back after all these years? Her long black hair is piled about\nher head. A few locks cover her right cheek, as if guarding her face,\nwhich has not changed with the years. Her eyebrows are carefully\nplucked, and her eyelids, which end in thick eyelashes, are shut.\nHer nose guards her lips, which bear pink lipstick as if she were still\nalive. Her nipples are erect; there is no trace of the surgery. Her\nhands are clasped over her navel; her fingernails and toenails are\npainted the same pink as her lipstick. Her pubic hair is shaved.\nI wonder whether she is asleep or dead. I am afraid to touch her. I\nlook into her face and whisper her name, “Reem.” She smiles, her\neyes still shut at first. Then she opens them, and the blackness in her\npupils smiles as well. I can't grasp what is going on. I ask in a loud\nvoice, “Reem, what are you doing here?"\nI am about to hug and kiss her, but she warns me: “Don't kiss me.\nWash me first so we can be together and then . . . ”\n"What? You are still alive?"\n“Wash me so we can be together. I missed you so much.”\n“But you are not dead!"\n“Wash me, darling . . . Wash me so we can be together.”\n“With what? There is nothing here."\n"Wash me, darling." Raindrops begin to fall, and she closes her eyes. I wipe a drop off\nher nose with my index finger. Her skin is warm, which means she is\nalive. I start to caress her hair. I will wash her with the rain, I think.\nShe smiles as if she'd heard my thought. Another drop settles above\nher left eyebrow. I wipe it off.\n\nI think I hear a car approaching. I turn around and see a Humvee\ndriving at an insane speed, leaving a trail of flying dust. It suddenly\nswerves to the right and comes to a stop a few meters away from us. Its\ndoors open. Masked men wearing khaki uniforms and carrying ma-\nchine guns rush toward us. I try to shield Reem with my right hand,\nbut one of the men has already reached me. He hits me in the face\nwith the stock of his machine gun. I fall to the ground. He kicks me in\nthe stomach. Another starts dragging me away from the washing\nbench. None of them says a word. I am screaming and cursing them,\nbut I can't hear myself. Two men force me to get down on my knees\nand tie my wrists with a wire behind my back. One of them puts a\nknife to my neck; the other blindfolds me. I try to run away, but they\nhold me tightly. I scream again, but cannot hear my screams. I hear\nonly Reem's shrieks, the laughter and grunts of the men, the sound of\nthe rain.\n\nI feel a sharp pain, then the cold blade of the knife penetrating\nmy neck. Hot blood spills over my chest and back. My head falls to\nthe ground and rolls like a ball on the sand. I hear footsteps. One of\nthe men takes off my blindfold and shoves it into his pocket. He spits\nin my face and goes away. I see my body to the left of the bench,\nkneeling in a puddle of blood.\n\nThe other men return to the Humvee, two of them dragging\nReem by her arms. She tries to turn her head back in my direction,\nbut one of them slaps her. I cry out her name but can't hear my\nvoice. They put her in the back seat and shut the door. The engine\nstarts. The Humvee speeds away and disappears over the horizon.\nThe rain keeps falling on the empty bench.\n\nI woke up panting and sweating. I wiped my forehead and face. The\nsame nightmare had been recurring for weeks, with minor changes.\n\n2 Sometimes I saw Reem's severed head on the bench and heard her\nvoice saying, "Wash me, darling,” but this was the first time there\nwas rain. It must have slipped into my dream from outdoors. I could\nhear drops on the window next to my bed.\nI looked at my watch. It was already 3:30 A.M.\nI've slept only three hours after a long and grueling day. I am\nworn out.\nDeath is not content with what it takes from me in my waking\nhours, it insists on haunting me even in my sleep. Isn't it enough\nthat I toil all day tending to its eternal guests, preparing them to\nsleep in its lap? Is death punishing me because I thought I could\nescape its clutches? If my father were still alive he would mock my\nsilly thoughts. He would dismiss all this as infantile, unbecoming to\na man. Didn't he spend a lifetime doing his job day after day, never\nonce complaining of death? But death back then was timid and\nmore measured than today.\nI can almost hear death saying: “I am what I am and haven't\nchanged at all. I am but a postman.”\nIf death is a postman, then I receive his letters every day. I am the\none who opens carefully the bloodied and torn envelopes. I am the\none who washes them, who removes the stamps of death and dries\nand perfumes them, mumbling what I don't entirely believe in.\nThen I wrap them carefully in white so they may reach their final\nreader-the grave.\nBut letters are piling up, Father! Tenfold more than what you used\nto see in the span of a week now pass before me in a day or two. If you\nwere alive, Father, would you say that that is fate and God's will? I\nwish you were here so I could leave Mother with you and escape\nwithout feeling guilty. You were heavily armed with faith, and that\nmade your heart a castle. My heart, by contrast, is an abandoned\nhouse whose windows are shattered and doors unhinged. Ghosts\nplay inside it, and the winds wail.\nAs a child, I would cover my head with a second pillow to block\nout noise. I look for it now; it has fallen by the bed next to my\nslippers. I pick it up and bury my head under it in order to reclaim my share of the night. The image of Reem being dragged away by\nher hair keeps returning.\nReem hadn't been at the heart of my nightmare until a few weeks\nago. Where was she now? I heard a few years ago that she was in\nAmsterdam. I'll Google her again tomorrow when I go to the Inter-\nnet café after work. I'll try a different spelling of her name in English\nand maybe I'll find something. But can I just grab a bit of sleep for\nan hour or two? I stood next to my mother on the steps in front of the big\nwooden door. Her right hand firmly clasped my right hand, as if I\nwere about to run or fly away. Her left hand carried the sufurtas in\nwhich she packed my father's lunch—three small copper pots, each\nstacked on top of the other in a metal skeleton resembling a little\nmetal building. The top pot was filled with rice. The middle one\nwith okra stew and two pieces of meat. The lower pot usually had\nsome fruit. That day she'd put in a tiny bunch of white grapes, the\nkind we call "goat nipples," that my father liked. There was a warm\nloaf of homemade bread in the nylon sack dangling from her left\nwrist. She put her left foot on the steps and temporarily released my\nhand to knock four times. Her strong knocks pushed the door open.\nShe pretended not to see the young man squatting a few steps away\nfrom the door with his back to the wall. He was wearing black. His\nhead was buried in his hands and he looked like he was wailing.\nSmoke rose from the cigarette in his left hand. That was the first\ntime I'd seen a grown man cry.\nI looked into my mother's coffee-colored eyes. In a hushed voice,\nI asked, "Why is this man crying?"\nShe put her index finger on her lips to shush me and whispered,\n“Don't be rude, Jawad!"\nI craned to the left, curious to see what was happening inside. It\nwas the first time my mother had taken me to my father's place of\nwork. He usually took the sufurtas with him in the morning, but that\nday he had forgotten to bring it along.\nThe narrow walkway led to a wide room with a high ceiling.\n\n5 Three or four men were standing at its entrance with their backs\nblocking the scene. Were they watching my father as he worked?\nThe street was quiet and although the walkway was long, I could\nhear the sound of water being spilled, with my father's voice mutter-\ning phrases I couldn't understand, except for the word "God."\nMy mother knocked at the open door with more force and deter-\nmination this time and then called out “Hammoudy.” None of the\nmen turned around. Then the one standing to the far left moved\naside and Hammoudy's face appeared. He limped to the door. Ham-\nmoudy, my father's assistant, looked older than his actual age. He\nhad black hair and eyelashes as thick as a paint brush. He wore blue\nshorts and a white T-shirt which was wet in many spots. After ex-\nchanging a quick hello, my mother gave him the sufurtas and the\nbread saying: "Here, Hammoudy, this is Abu Ammoury's lunch. He\nforgot to take it.”\nHe thanked her and rushed back inside after shutting the door.\nShe held my hand again and we started to make our way back\nhome. I turned back to look at the squatting man. His head was still\nin his hands. My mother shook me and said, “Mind where you're\ngoing. You're going to trip and fall."\nAt that age I didn't know much about my father's work. All I knew\nwas that he was a mghassilchi, a body-washer, but this word was\nobscure to me. I was afraid that day and asked my mother: “Does\nFather hurt people?"\n“No son, not at all. It's quite the opposite. Why do you ask?"\n"But wasn't that man there crying?"\n"Yes, but not because of your father. He's just sad."\n“Why is he sad? What are they doing inside?"\n"Your dad washes the bodies of the dead. It's a very honorable\nprofession and those who do it are rewarded by God."\n"Why does he wash them? Are they dirty?"\n“No, but they must be purified."\n"And where do the dead go after they die?"\n"To God. Your father tends to them before they are buried."\n“How can they go to God if they are buried?” “The soul rises to the sky, but the body remains in the earth it\ncame from. It is said that we are come from Adam and Adam is of\ndust."\n\nI looked up to the sky. There were five clouds huddled together\nand I wondered: Which one will carry the dead man's soul? Where\nwill it take it? The only time I ever saw my father cry was many years later\nwhen he heard that my brother Ameer, whom we called Ammoury,\nhad died. Ameer, who was five years my senior, was transformed\nfrom "Doctor” into “Martyr.” His framed black-and-white photo-\ngraph occupied the heart of the main wall in our living room and\neven a bigger part of my father's heart, which Ammoury had already\nmonopolized. Ameer, you see, was the ideal son who had always\nmade my father proud. He always excelled and was the top of his\nclass. At the national baccalaureate exams, his score was 95 percent,\nwhich enabled him to go to medical school to study to become a\nsurgeon. Ameer wanted to fulfill his dream of opening a clinic so he\ncould allow Father to retire. Father insisted that he would keep\nworking until he died. Ameer insisted on helping Father at work\neven on his short leaves from the army during the years of war with\nIran. This was before he was killed in the al-Faw battles.\n\nI was reading in my room on the second floor when I heard a car\nstop in front of the house and doors being slammed shut. Seconds\nlater, I heard the new doorbell ringing—the doorbell Ameer had\nbought and installed after the old one had stopped working and I\nhad procrastinated about fixing it. I drew the curtain open and saw a\ntaxi with a flag-draped coffin on top of it. My heart sunk into an\nabyss.\n\nWhenever I saw a taxi driving down the street with a flag-draped\ncoffin on it, the thought would cross my mind that Ammoury might\none day return like this, but I would quickly cast the vision aside. I\nrushed down the stairs barefoot. When I reached the front door my\n\n8	2025-01-03 19:35:21.815324	2025-01-03 19:35:21.815327	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf- Sinan Antoon - The Corpse Washer (beginning)-1390", "chunks_count": 6}

Completion bonds,\npay or play provisions, and crowdfunding are also explained.\nThe note concludes with steps counsel can take to protect\nthe interest of clients investing in motion pictures and the\nrole of security interests in the context of film financing.\nTopics discussed in this practice note include:\n•\nStudio Financing\n•\nBank Loans Based on Pre-sales\n•\nDomestic Tax Incentives\n•\nIn-Kind Incentives\n•\nInternational Tax Incentives\n•\nPublic Offerings\n•\nPrivate Placements\n•\n•\nExemptions for Private Placements\nCompletion Bonds\n•\nPay or Play\n•\nCrowdfunding with Donations\n•\nObtaining and Registering a Security Interest\nArranging financing for film projects is often difficult even\nfor experienced producers. Unlike many other products,\nno one can really predict the potential success of a film,\nand therefore, there is always significant financial risk with\nany production. Most films are not financially successful\nendeavors.\nMost projects will be owned by a special purpose or single\npurpose vehicle (SPV) that is typically a corporation or\na limited liability company. These entities are created to\ninsulate the assets of the producer, any parent company,\nand the financiers from liability. Insurance companies\nalso prefer a new entity that has no liabilities from past\nactivities. The SPV will contract with cast, director, crew,\ninvestors, any guilds, and distributors.\nFor related practical guidance, see Motion Picture\nProduction Agreements and Documents, Loan Agreement\n(Financing Motion Picture) and Laboratory Pledgeholder\nAgreement (Financing Motion Picture).\nStudio Financing\nFor experienced producers with a track record, the easiest\npath is often to present a package of script, principal\nactors, director, and budget to a major studio such as\nWarner Brothers, with a request that they finance the\nproject. If the studio says yes, keeping in mind that only a\nsmall percentage of the projects pitched are approved, the\nstudio will provide the entire budget. The film will be fully\nfinanced, and the budget will include a production services\nfee of approximately 10% to compensate the producers for their services. Producers may also be able to negotiate\nbonuses, deferments, and profit participation. The studio\nwill own the movie and usually will have the right to\nmake changes and control the final cut of the film. Major\nstreamers like Netflix also enter into such production deals.\nIn this scenario, there is minimal financial risk to the\nproducer because the studio is providing the entire budget.\nMoreover, there will be a contingency line of about 10%\nof the budget to cover any unanticipated overages. There\nmay also be a completion bond to insure completion. If you\nare a producer with a track record, this may be the quickest\nway to fund your project. But many aspiring producers\ncannot get in the door to pitch their projects to a major\nstudio or streamer.\nNegative Pickup Deal\nA negative pickup deal is a variation of studio financing.\nThe studio guarantees payment of the budget on delivery\nof the film for a fixed amount. The producer needs to\nfinance the production and is paid on delivery of the film.\nThis scenario is similar to a pre-sale agreement of foreign\nrights, as explained below. "Negative" refers to film\nnegative, which often does not exist today as many films\nare now shot on a digital medium.\nBank Loans Based on\nPre-sales\nAn alternative way to finance a film involves debt financing\nfrom a bank or third party. One avenue is when a producer\n(or sales agent) raises funding by preselling distribution\nrights to various territory buyers and then uses those\ncontracts as collateral for a production loan. For example,\na German distributor wanting to distribute the project in\nGermany might enter into a license agreement for a film to\nbe produced. Financing through pre-sales can be a difficult\nprocess because there are many different agreements that\nneed to be made with buyers that may have competing\ninterests.\nInternational sales agents are a type of distributor, although\nthey usually do not own a single theater, home video\nlabel, or television outlet. They are essentially distributors\nthat license films to local or territory distributors (buyers).\nTerritory distributors acquire rights to exhibit a film within\ntheir country or license rights for several different countries\n(such as all Scandinavian rights). They often learn about\nupcoming projects from sales agents who they meet at\nvarious film and television markets held throughout the\nyear. Sales agents and buyers typically attend the three\nmajor film markets, which are at Cannes, Berlin, and Santa\nMonica (AFM), as well as TV markets such as Mip and\nMipCom.\nPre-sales require a distributor to sign a contract to license\na movie for distribution in their country even though the\nmovie does not yet exist. By pre-buying the movie, the\nbuyer knows that when it is completed they will not have\nto compete with other buyers for the rights to distribute\nthe film in their territory. On the other hand, if the movie\ndoes not turn out well, they have already committed to buy\nthe rights. These agreements, mostly focused on buyers in\nlarge territories that can offer a substantial license fee, such\nas France or the United Kingdom, are used as collateral\nfor a production loan. Pre-sale buyers will usually require\na completion bond before committing to license a movie.\nThe bond is an insurance policy that guarantees that the\nfilm will be delivered on time and within budget-or their\ninvestment will be returned. See Completion Bonds.\nFor more information and pre-sale and completion\nguarantee templates, see Entertainment Industry Contracts\n16.01-16-2 and Entertainment Industry Contracts 16A.01-\n16A-3.\nWhen relying on production bank loans based on pre-\nsales, a producer must first assemble a package including\nthe script, stars, director, and budget. Writing a great script\ncan take years of effort. Once the script is ready, the\nproducer then assembles the other elements. However,\npre-sale buyers, and directors may want to approve the\nscript, budget, and stars before making a commitment. For\nexample, a buyer might insist that the producer hire an\nactor who has a following in their country to make the film\nmore marketable there.\nThere are a limited number of specialized banks that\nwill provide production financing. These banks are\nknowledgeable about the buyers and whether they are\nfinancially sound and likely to pay for the film upon\ndelivery. The borrower (producer) will assign to the bank\n(lender) a security interest in the collateral which is all\nof the borrower's rights in the motion picture and any\nproceeds from it. The sales agent will have acquired the\nright to distribute the motion picture from the borrower.\nCompletion Guarantor\nThe bank and a completion guarantor enter into a\ncompletion guarantee agreement pursuant to which the\ncompletion guarantor company has guaranteed to the bank\nthat the picture will be completed and delivered to the\nsales agent. In other words, if there are cost overruns and\nthe production budget does not have sufficient funds to\ncomplete the picture, the completion guarantor will step in and advance those funds so the picture can be delivered.\nThe bank assigns to the completion guarantor a security\ninterest in the collateral subject only to the bank's rights\nunder the loan agreement.\nThe completion bond company, bank, borrower, and\nsales agent will enter into an interparty agreement that\nwill supersede the other agreements entered into by\nthe parties. It will require the sales agent to approve the\nscreenplay, principal cast, director, producer, and budget\nof the picture, and to remit all receipts derived from the\npicture to the bank to repay the production loan. The\nborrower, sales agent, completion guarantor, bank, and\neach distributor will enter into a notice of assignment. This\nagreement assigns all amounts payable by the distributor to\nthe completion guarantor, subject to the rights of the bank.\nAll revenues are remited to the bank and the completion\nguarantor (if they have advanced monies) until they have\nbeen repaid. For related templates, see Loan Agreement\n(Financing Motion Picture) and Laboratory Pledgeholder\nAgreement (Financing Motion Picture).\nThe production company, which is usually the borrower,\nwill also have to negotiate various production agreements\nbefore the loan will be disbursed. For further discussion,\nsee Motion Picture Production Agreements and Documents.\nFinally, the bank will require that certain insurance policies\nbe purchased including liability and errors and omissions\ninsurance. For more on errors and omissions insurance\napplications and clearance procedures, see Entertainment\nIndustry Contracts P 15.01.\nDomestic Tax Incentives\nAnother method to partially finance films relies on tax\nincentives to cover a portion of the production budget.\nIn this context, tax incentives are sometimes referred to\nas "soft money." These rebates are usually based on the\namount spent on production within the applicable state.\nSome states allow producers to transfer their incentive to\na third party and receive cash for it to provide production\nfinancing.\nFor example, Georgia offers a tax credit of 20%-30% for\nmoney spent on crew. There is a 20% base tax credit and\nan additional 10% that can be earned by including an\nembedded Georgia logo on the film and a link to Explore\nGeorgia.org/Film on the project's landing page. Production\nexpenditures must be made in Georgia from a Georgia\nvendor to qualify. There is a minimum expenditure of\n$500,000 required. For a project to be eligible for the\n20% transferable tax credit, the Georgia Department of\nEconomic Development must certify the project. (More\ninformation may be found on the Georgia state website.)\nIn-Kind Incentives\nAnother type of incentive may be reduced prices for\nlocations, facilities, use of police, and permit fees. New York\nCity, for example, provides a tax credit, free police traffic\ncontrol, and does not charge for permits. See New York\nCity Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment.\nCertain companies may offer free products for use in a\nfilm in exchange for showing the product on screen. This\nis known as product placement. The producer is permitted\nto feature a company's product in the film, along with\na release of any intellectual property rights. Sometimes,\nmanufacturers may pay a fee to include their product in\na film. For an in-depth discussion of product placement\nagreements, see Product Placement Agreements.\nInternational Tax Incentives\nIn addition to domestic incentive programs, producers\nalso consider other benefits that can arise from taking a\nproduction abroad. In Eastern Europe and South Africa, for\nexample, the wage scale is so low that local crew members\nand extras can be hired for a fraction of the cost of those\nin the United States. Likewise, food, lodging, equipment,\nand construction costs can be a bargain. If a producer\ncan hire crew members or book a hotel for 20% of what\nthose items would cost in the U.S., then the producer\nis essentially receiving an 80% subsidy. But savings may\nbe offset by increased travel and accommodations costs,\nwhich may be negligible for a moviemaker shooting in\nthe moviemaker's own community. Additionally, some\nlocations may not offer the equipment rentals needed for\na shoot. If you shoot in New York or Los Angeles, and a\ncamera breaks, it can be replaced in a few hours from local\nvendors. That is not necessarily the case if you need a\nreplacement in a far-off locale.\nProductions in Canada\nCanada has been very successful in luring American\nproductions to its country. Toronto and Vancouver have a\ndeep reservoir of skilled and experienced crew members,\nso numerous productions can shoot simultaneously. A\nfavorable exchange rate with the U.S. dollar may allow\nAmerican producers to stretch their resources by buying\ngoods and services for less.\nCanada offers a variety of programs designed to support\nboth Canadian and foreign producers. A distinction is made between Canadian content films, which receive a generous\ntax credit, and films without Canadian content, which are\neligible for a substantial but lesser credit. Producers cannot\nreceive benefits under both programs simultaneously, but\nthey may combine these production incentives with those\noffered by Canada's provincial governments.\nMany countries have co-production treaties that allow\nfilmmakers to take advantage of incentive programs in\nseveral countries simultaneously. Canada, for example, has\nentered into more than 50 co-production treaties with\nother countries. These allow their filmmakers to combine\nincentives from several countries. However, each country\nwill require certain minimum local elements to qualify. The\nproduction may have to shoot in Canada, arrange post-\nproduction in South Africa, and include cast and crew\nfrom both. Note that changing scripts and cast merely to\nattract co-financing does not necessarily improve a film.\n"Europudding" is the derogatory term for bad movies\ncomprised of awkward stories welded together to attract\nmultisource financing.\nFor information on tax incentives worldwide, see\n_Entertainment Partners_. For additional information on film\ncommissions, see the Association of Film Commissioners\nInternational.\nPublic Offerings\nA public offering is a process by which an issuer offers\nsecurities such as equity shares to investors on the open\nmarket. Independent filmmakers rarely attempt to raise\nfunds from a public offering on a public market such as\nthe New York Stock Exchange. The accounting and legal\nexpenses amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nInitial public offerings (IPOs) occur when a company sells\nshares on listed stock exchanges for the first time. A public\noffering usually requires the issuing company to publish a\nprospectus detailing the terms and rights attached to the\noffered security, as well as information on the company\nitself and its finances. Many other regulatory requirements\nsurround a public offering. An investment underwriter\nusually manages or facilitates public offerings. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must approve all\nregistrations for public offerings of securities in the United\nStates.\nFor an in-depth discussion of IPOs, see _Initial Public\nOffering Process_ and _Initial Public Offerings Resource Kit_ in\nthe Capital Markets & Corporate Governance practice area\nof Practical Guidance. See also U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission - Regulation A.\nPrivate Placements\nFilmmakers try to avoid the burden and expense of\nSEC registration by qualifying for one or more of the\nexemptions to registration. These exemptions are largely\nrestricted to private placements, which generally entail\napproaching people one already knows (i.e., the parties\nhave a preexisting relationship) rather than offering an\ninterest to the public at large. Private investors are often\nfamily or friends, or others who are willing to take a lot\nof risk because if the script does not turn out well, or the\nproducer cannot attract the other elements needed to\nmake a successful film, their investment can be completely\nwritten off.\nProducers will need an investment agreement for projects\nfunded by private investors. These offerings are often\nsubject to state and federal security laws designed to\nprotect investors. An equity investment can be structured in\na number of different ways such as using a corporation, an\nLLC, or a limited partnership.\nActive vs. Passive Investors\nA major consideration is whether the investors are going\nto be active or passive. An active investor is one that is\nmanaging the business with you. If all the investors are\nactive, such as when a writer, director, producer, and actor\ncollaboratively make a film and finance it themselves, the\ndeal can be structured as a joint venture or co-production.\nSince all the parties are involved in making the movie,\nthere are no security issues, and you may only need a co-\nproduction agreement among the parties, and often an\nLLC to make and own the movie. Such a co-production or\ncollaboration agreement would set out the various rights\nand obligations of the partners including what screen\ncredits each would receive, what tasks they would handle,\nand how decisions would be made.\nHowever, if any of the investors are passive, meaning they\nare putting money into the endeavor but have little or no\nother involvement in making the movie or running the\nbusiness, then the security laws will apply. State and federal\nsecurities laws are designed to protect such investors\nby ensuring that the people managing the business do\nnot defraud them by giving them false or misleading\ninformation, or by failing to disclose information that a\nreasonably prudent investor would want to know. These\nlaws have strict requirements and it can be complex and\nexpensive to comply with them. A single technical violation\ncan subject general partners to both civil and criminal\nliability. Exemptions for Private\nPlacements\nThere are several of exemptions for private placements.\nIntrastate Offerings\nThere is an exemption for intrastate offerings by an issuer\nwithin that state that is limited to investors all of whom\nreside in that state. To qualify for the intrastate offering\nexemption Rule 147 (17 C.F.R. § 230.147), a company\nmust:\n•\nBe incorporated in the state where it is offering the\nsecurities -and-\n•\nCarry out a significant amount of its business in that\nstate\nThere is no fixed limit on the size of the offering or the\nnumber of purchasers under federal law. Relying solely on\nthis exemption can be risky, however, because if an offer is\nmade to a single nonresident the exemption could be lost.\nIssuers conducting an offering pursuant to Rule 147 or Rule\n147A are not required to file any information with or pay\nany fees to the SEC. Issuers, however, must comply with\nstate securities laws and regulations in the state in which\nsecurities are offered or sold.\nFor further information, see the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission's Intrastate Offering Exemptions: A\nSmall Entity Compliance Guide for Issuers.\nRegulation D\nUnder SEC Regulation D (Reg. D), there are several\nexemptions from federal registration. These can permit\nfilmmakers to offer and sell their securities without having\nto register the securities with the SEC as required for public\nofferings.\nWhile companies relying on a Reg. D exemption do not\nhave to register their securities and usually do not have\nto file reports with the SEC, they must file a document\nknown as Form D when they initially sell their securities.\nThis document gives notice of the names and addresses of\nthe company's owners and promoters. State laws may also\napply, in which case the offeror will likely need to file a\ndocument with the appropriate state agency for every state\nin which an investor resides.\nBlue Sky Laws\nState registration can be avoided by complying with the\nrequirements for limited offering exemptions under state\nlaw. These laws are often referred to as "Blue Sky" laws.\nThey were enacted after the stock market crash that\noccurred during the Great Depression. They are designed\nto protect investors from being duped into buying securities\nthat are worthless-backed by nothing more than the blue\nsky. See Securities and Transaction Exemptions under Blue\nSky Laws in the Capital Markets & Corporate Governance\npractice area of Practical Guidance.\nThe above-mentioned federal and state exemptions may\nrestrict offerors in several ways. Sales are typically limited\nto 35 nonaccredited investors, and the investors may\nneed to have a preexisting relationship with the issuer (or\ninvestment sophistication adequate to understand the\ntransaction), the purchasers cannot purchase for resale, and\nadvertising or general solicitation is usually not permitted.\nThere is generally no limit on the number of accredited\ninvestors.\nA "preexisting relationship" is defined as any relationship\nconsisting of personal or business contacts of a nature\nand duration such as would enable a reasonably prudent\npurchaser to be aware of the character, business acumen,\nand general business and financial circumstances of the\nperson with whom the relationship exists.\n504 Offering (17 C.F.R. § 230.504)\nA 504 Offering under Regulation D exempts from\nregistration the offer and sale of up to $10 million of\nsecurities in a 12-month period. A company is required\nto file a notice with the Commission on Form D within\n15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering.\nIn addition, a company must comply with state securities\nlaws and regulations in the states in which securities are\noffered or sold. Because one also has to comply with state\nsecurities laws, this section is not used as often as the 506\noffering below.\nThe following companies are not eligible to use Rule 504:\n•\nExchange Act reporting companies\n•\nInvestment companies\n•\nCompanies that have no specific business plan or have\nindicated their business plan is to engage in a merger or\nacquisition with an unidentified company or companies\n-and-\n•\nCompanies that are disqualified under Rule 504's "bad\nactor" disqualification provisions\nUnder the Securities Act, some offerings are not required\nto be registered or qualified by state securities regulators.\nEven if the offering is made under one of those\nexemptions, the states still have authority to investigate\nand bring enforcement actions for fraud, impose state notice filing requirements, and collect state fees. The failure\nto file or pay filing fees regarding any such materials may\ncause state securities regulators to suspend the offer or\nsale of securities within their jurisdiction. Companies should\ncontact state securities regulators in the states in which\nthey intend to offer or sell securities for further guidance\non compliance with state law requirements. You can locate\nyour state security regulator on the North American\nSecurities Administrators Association (NASAA) website.\n506 Offerings (17 C.F.R. § 230.506)\nThere are two offerings under Rule 506, 506(b) and 506(c).\nRule 506(b) (17 C.F.R. § 230.506(b))\nUnder Rule 506(b), a company can be assured it is within\nthe Section 4(a)(2) exemption by satisfying the following\nstandards:\n•\nThe company cannot use general solicitation or\nadvertising to market the securities.\n•\nThe company may sell its securities to an unlimited\nnumber of "accredited investors" and up to 35 other\npurchasers.\n•\nUnlike former Rule 505, all nonaccredited investors,\neither alone or with a purchaser representative, must\nbe sophisticated that is, they must have sufficient\nknowledge and experience in financial and business\nmatters to make them capable of evaluating the merits\nand risks of the prospective investment.\n•\nCompanies must decide what information to give to\naccredited investors, so long as it does not violate the\nanti-fraud prohibitions of the federal securities laws.\n•\nCompanies must give nonaccredited investors disclosure\ndocuments that are generally the same as those used in\nregistered offerings.\n•\nIf a company provides information to accredited\ninvestors, it must make this information available to\nnonaccredited investors as well.\n•\nThe company must be available to answer questions by\nprospective purchasers.\nUnder Rule 506(b), one can raise an unlimited amount of\ncapital. These offerings are not subject to state registration\nor qualification. There is no limit as to the number of\naccredited investors that can participate. However, only\n35 nonaccredited investors can participate. For further\ninformation and related content, see Private Placements\nResource Kit in the Capital Markets & Corporate\nGovernance practice area of Practical Guidance.\nRule 506(c) (17 C.F.R. § 230.506(c))\nUnder Rule 506(c), a company can broadly solicit and\ngenerally advertise the offering, but still be deemed to be\na private offering within Section 4(a)(2) if (1) the investors\nin the offering are all accredited investors and (2) the\ncompany has taken reasonable steps to verify that its\ninvestors are accredited investors. Verification could include\nreviewing documentation such as W-2s, tax returns, bank\nand brokerage statements, credit reports, and the like.\nAccredited investors include (among others) the following:\n•\nAny natural persons whose individual net worth, or joint\nnet worth with that person's spouse, at the time of the\npurchase exceeds $1,000,000, excluding their primary\nresidence\n•\nAny natural person with an individual income in the two\nprior years and an estimated income in the current year\nin excess of $200,000 or joint income with spouse of\n$300,000\n•\nAny director, executive officer, or general partner of the\nissuer of the securities being offered or sold -or-\n•\nAny director, executive officer, or partner of a general\npartner of the issuer\nUnder Rule 506, each purchaser of units must be\n"sophisticated," as that term is defined under federal law.\nNote that an "accredited investor" is not the same as\n"sophisticated" investor. The term "accredited investor"\nis specifically defined by the federal securities laws, while\nthe term "sophisticated investor" has no precise legal\ndefinition. Both terms generally refer to an investor who\nhas a sufficiently high degree of financial knowledge and\nexpertise such that they do not need the protections\nafforded by the SEC. An investor who is considered\n"sophisticated," might not meet the precise definition of an\naccredited investor.\nIt is up to the offeror to decide what information is given\nto accredited investors, provided there is no violation of\nthe anti-fraud provisions. Nonaccredited investors must\nbe given disclosure documents similar to those used in\nregistered offerings. If the offeror provides information to\naccredited investors, the same information must be given\nto nonaccredited investors. The offeror must be available to\nanswer questions by prospective purchasers.\nUnder Rule 506, each purchaser must represent that they\nare purchasing the units for their own investment only and\nnot with plans to sell or otherwise distribute the units. The\nunits purchased are "restricted" and may not be resold by\nthe investor except in certain circumstances. All security offerings, even those exempt from registration\nunder Reg. D, are subject to the anti-fraud provisions\nof the federal securities laws, and any applicable state\nanti-fraud provisions. Consequently, the offeror will be\nresponsible for any false or misleading statements, whether\noral or written. Those who violate the law can be pursued\nboth criminally and civilly. Moreover, an investor who has\npurchased a security on the basis of misleading information,\nor the omission of relevant information, can rescind\nthe investment agreement and obtain a refund of their\ninvestment.\nIt is customary for the private placement memorandum\nto contain detailed information about the risks of the\ninvestment, the biographies of the principals, a budget\nsummary, and other information a reasonably prudent\ninvestor would want to know.\nDocumentation\nCounsel must prepare a number of different documents for\na private placement to give to potential investors. These\ninclude the following:\n•\nA private placement memorandum (PPM)\n•\nAn operating agreement of LLC (or bylaws for a\ncorporation or partnership agreement if a partnership)\n•\nA subscription agreement\n•\nAn investor questionnaire\n•\nForms to file in each state in which you are making an\noffer\nOther documents may need to be filed with federal and\nstate governments:\n•\nA Certificate of Limited Partnership may need to\nbe filed with the secretary of state to establish a\npartnership.\n•\nIf the transaction is subject to federal law, Form D will\nneed to be filed electronically with the SEC within 15\ndays after the first sale.\n•\nIn California, a notice of the transaction and consent\nto service of process is filed with the Department of\nCorporations.\nPPMs can be made under different offering rules.\nFor an overview of U.S. federal securities laws, see\nU.S. Securities Laws in the Capital Markets & Corporate\nGovernance practice area of Practical Guidance.

Investors are often concerned about\nwhat happens if the producer runs out of money before\nproduction has been completed and the film delivered. In\norder to provide reassurance, the producer will often secure\na completion bond. This is a special type of insurance\nthat provides completion funds if a movie goes over\nbudget. Such overages may occur, for example, when the\nproduction encounters unforeseen circumstances such as\nbad weather or a star getting sick. Perhaps the worst-case\nscenario is the death of a star before completing the role.\nIn such a scenario, the completion bond company steps in\nto supply enough funds to finish the film. Or if the project\ncannot be completed, it will reimburse the investors for\ntheir contributions. Completion bonds are expensive, usually\ncosting 3% or more of the net production budget. Some\ncompanies may rebate part of this fee if no claims are\nmade. Completion bond companies usually will not bond\nlow budget films.\nCompletion bond companies are selective in which projects\nthey are willing to insure. They want their premium dollars\nbut do not want to take unnecessary risks. Therefore, they\nimpose many conditions before they will issue a completion\nbond. The bond companies have experts on staff to review\nbudgeting and production, and they will make sure the\nbudget is a realistic estimate of what it will cost to make\nthe movie. The "strike price," or "production price" is the\namount that the guarantor believes will be needed in order\nto complete and deliver the film. This includes above and\nbelow the line costs, fringes, insurance and financing costs,\nthe completion bond guarantor's fee, and a contingency\nallowance.\nThe contingency line in the budget is usually about 10% of\ndirect expenses to cover unanticipated costs. For example,\na $20 million film might allocate up to $2 million for these\nunforeseen overages. The bond is usually issued right\nbefore production commences because a lot of documents\nand approvals need to be secured. The bond company\nrequires signed contracts with the director and the stars\nfirmly committing them to perform in the movie. An actor\nexpressing interest in the film is not the same as one\nsigning a binding contract. If the production is funded in\npart by a bank loan, the bank will not disburse the funds\nuntil the completion bond company issues the bond. The bond company will also insist that the producer buys\nthe following insurance:\n•\nLiability and errors and omission insurance\n•\nInsurance to cover equipment breakdowns\n•\nCast insurance\n•\nWorkers compensation -and-\n•\nNegative insurance to ensure the film negative or hard\ndrive is not defective\nThe bond company will review the credentials and\nbackground of all the key people making the movie, such as\nthe department heads, director, producer, and principal cast.\nIf your star has a history of drug use, or being unreliable,\nthat person may not be bondable, and the bond company\nmight refuse to insure the production. Stars may also have\nto submit to a medical exam.\nIn the event the bond company agrees to bond the film, it\nis given extraordinary powers. The bond company can fire\nthe director if they go over budget. The bond company is\nliable for overages, so if a director is taking more time than\nexpected, the director can be replaced.\nThis process of packaging a project can be intense for\nthe producer because so many deals need to be finalized\nquickly. What happens if the producer signs a deal with a\nstar and guarantees a $1,000,000 fee with a start date of\nJuly 1, and then is unable to secure a co-star, director, or\nother essential element of the package? The producer could\nlose the star, have to pay the fee, and then need to restart\nthe process.\nPay or Play\nMovie stars usually will not agree to perform in a film\nwithout the producer committing to pay them on a pay\nor play basis. This means they get paid even if the project\ndoes not go into production, provided they are not in\ndefault. If you are a star like George Clooney, you are\noffered dozens of projects every year. Even an actor who is\na workaholic only has time to perform in a few movies each\nyear because each one takes several months to shoot, with\nadditional rehearsal and post-production time.\nThus, if you offer Margot Robbie a role in your movie,\nand she wants to do it, she will not firmly commit to it\nuntil you give her a start date and a pay or play guarantee\nthat she will be paid her fee regardless of whether or\nnot you actually commence production. This is because\nMargot Robbie knows once she signs a contract with you,\nif the next day she is offered the role of a lifetime in a\nmovie about something she cares deeply about, she will\nhave to turn that job down. She is therefore not going to\nfirmly commit to be in your movie until you have secured\nthe entire production budget, or at least commit to pay\nher regardless of whether you can assemble all other\nelements needed to go into production. Moreover, if you\nare an independent producer, you will likely have to make\na substantial deposit in an escrow account for her to sign\na contract. If she is contracting with a major studio, she\nmight not require this, but for an independent producer,\nher agents may insist on a deposit. Stars may also require\napproval over the selection of the director, co-star, and any\nscript changes.\nFor further information, see Entertainment Industry\nContracts P 16A.01-16A.02.\nCrowdfunding with\nDonations\nCrowdfunding refers to the process of raising money\nto fund a project or business through numerous small\ncontributors, often using an online platform or funding\nportal to solicit investment. Because investing in film is\nsuch a risky endeavor, being able to spread that risk among\nmany people may substantially increase the amount of\nfinancing available for a film. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (Pub. L. No. 115-97), crowdfunding could only\nbe accomplished by seeking donations. Web portals such\nas Kickstarter and Indiegogo could help filmmakers raise\nsuch donations. While those who made a donation could\nnot share in any profits, they might receive certain benefits,\nsuch as a screen credit on the film, a poster, t-shirts, or\nother "swag."\nCrowdfunding Investments\nWith passage of the JOBS Act, promoters are now able\nto offer a share of the profits in a project. This will likely\nencourage small investors who want to participate in film\nor other start-up businesses, but can only afford to make a\nmodest investment.\nFunding portals are platforms that provide investors\nwith information about investments being offered. These\nportals are designed to allow internet-based platforms or\nintermediaries to facilitate the offer and sale of securities\nwithout having to register with the SEC as brokers. Portals\nare required to register with the commission and become\na member of a national securities association, currently\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

Through the twentieth century in the United States and other\nhigh-income countries, growth in real incomes was accompanied by a\nhistorically unprecedented decline in mortality rates that caused life expectancy at\nbirth to grow by nearly 30 years.\nThe value of reductions in mortality risk can be roughly estimated from\n(admittedly heroic extrapolations of) differential wages in the labor market corre-\nsponding to differentials in the risk of death across occupations. Applying this\nmethodology, Nordhaus (2002, p. 35) has calculated that “to a first approximation,\nthe economic value of increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as\nlarge as the value of measured growth in nonhealth goods and services.” Falling\nmortality has also usually meant better health for the living, so that people are also\nliving better, healthier, and longer lives than did their forebears. Murphy and\nTopel (2005), who measure both the value of mortality decline and the benefits of\nbetter health for the living, estimate that, between 1970 and 2000, the annual value\nof increased longevity was about half of conventionally measured national income.\nImprovements in life expectancy in the United States have been matched by\nsimilar improvements in other rich countries. Indeed, there has been a rapid\n■ David Cutler is Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics, Harvard University, Cam-\nbridge, Massachusetts, Angus Deaton is Dwight D.

Outside of the rich countries, average health\nis strongly correlated with income. As shown in Figure 1, the current version of a\ngraph first drawn by Preston (1975) in which countries are represented by circles\nand the size of the circle is proportional to population, life-expectancy is pro-\nfoundly lower for countries with lower levels of per capita income.\nIn the years just after World War II, life expectancy gaps between countries\nwere falling across the world. Poor countries enjoyed rapid increases in life-\nexpectancy in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, with the gains in some cases exceeding\nan additional year of life expectancy per year. The HIV/AIDS epidemic and the\ntransition in Russia and eastern Europe have changed that situation. The best\nestimates of life-expectancy in some sub-Saharan African countries are lower now\nthan they were in 1950. Life expectancy in Russia fell by nearly seven years over the\n1990s. However, at least up to the 1990s, compound welfare measures that incor-\nporate both health and income show both much greater inequality at any point in\ntime and much greater international convergence than do income measures alone\n(Becker, Philipson and Soares, 2005).\nThere is also a positive relationship between income and health within\ncountries-low-income people live shorter lives than high-income people in a given\ncountry. Americans in the bottom 5 percent of the income distribution in 1980 had\na life-expectancy at all ages that was about 25 percent lower than the corresponding\nlife-expectancies of those in the top 5 percent of the income distribution (Rogot,\nSorlie, Johnson and Schmitt, 1992). These “health inequalities,” also known as\n\nDavid Cutler, Angus Deaton and Adriana Lleras-Muney 99\ngradients, are part of a wider pattern that relates mortality to measures of socio-\neconomic status. For example, American blacks had a life expectancy in 2002 that\nwas 5.4 years less than that of American whites. In England and Wales in 1997–2001,\nmale manual workers could expect to live 8.4 years less than professionals, a gap\nthat has increased since the early 1970s.\nThe decline in mortality over time, differences in mortality across countries\nand differences in mortality across groups within countries are phenomena worthy\nof serious attention by economists and others. We will first lay out the historical\ndecline in mortality, then move to mortality differences between rich and poor\ncountries, and then discuss differences in mortality within countries. A good theory\nof mortality should explain all of the facts we will outline. No such theory exists at\npresent, but at the end of the paper we will sketch a tentative synthesis.\nDeterminants of the Historical Decline in Mortality\nFor most of human history, life was properly described in the famous phrase of\nThomas Hobbes as “nasty, brutish, and short.” From the dawn of Homo sapiens\nperhaps 100,000 years ago until the first agricultural revolution in roughly 10,000\nBCE, world population was about four million people. Life expectancy at birth for\nour hunter-gatherer ancestors was perhaps 25 years. There had been little, if any,\nprogress by the Roman Empire, and even in 1700, life expectancy at birth in\nEngland-after the Netherlands, the richest country in the world at the time—was\nonly 37 years (Wrigley and Schofield, 1981).\nIn the eighteenth century, mortality began to decline. In England and Wales\n(which we refer to as “England” for convenience), the decline started around the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. By 1820, life expectancy at birth in England was\nabout 41 years, up six years over the previous century. Between 1820 and 1870, the\nperiod of greatest industrialization, life expectancy remained stable at about\n41 years. Since 1870, mortality has fallen relatively continuously as well as more\nrapidly than in the first phase of mortality decline. Life expectancy in England\nclimbed to 50 years in the first decade of the twentieth century, and is about 77\nyears today. A similar transition, with some moderate differences in timing, took\nplace in all developed countries. Mortality reduction in France was broadly similar\nto that in England. In the United States, the mortality reduction appears to start\naround 1790, with a similar overall pattern. Life expectancy at birth in the United\nStates rose from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years today.\nThe reduction in mortality was not uniform by age. The vast bulk of the\nhistorical reduction in mortality occurred at younger ages. Figure 2 shows trends in\nlife expectancy by age in England since 1840. Between 1841 and 1950, life expect-\nancy at birth increased by 30 years, while life expectancy at age ten increased by\nonly half that amount. The decline in infectious disease explains this disparate age\npattern. In 1848, 60 percent of deaths in England were from infectious disease.\nBetween then and 1971, infectious disease mortality declined by 95 percent. Since\n\n100 Journal of Economic Perspectives\nFigure 2\nExpected Age at Death, England and Wales\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n1751\n1761\n1771\n1781\n1791\n1801\n1811\n1821\n1831\n1841\n1850\n1860\n1870\n1880\n1890\n1900\n1910\n1920\n1930\n1940\n1950\n1960\n1970\n1980\n1990\nBirth\nAge 65\nAge 45\nAge 10\nSource: Data for 1751-1841 are from Wrigley and Schofield (1981, Table 7.15, p. 230); data from\n1841 are from the Human Mortality Database.\ninfants and children are the most vulnerable to infections, their mortality rates were\nmost affected by the decline in infections. The sources of the reduction in infec-\ntious disease mortality have been extensively debated in the demographic commu-\nnity. We discuss the relevant factors in (possible) order of historical importance and\nconclude with some open issues.\nImproved Nutrition\nAgricultural yields increased significantly during the eighteenth century. Better-\nfed people resist most bacterial (although not viral) disease better, and recover\nmore rapidly and more often. The British physician and demographer Thomas\nMcKeown was the first person to argue for the importance of nutrition in improved\nhealth, writing several seminal papers on the topic which culminated in his widely\nread 1976 book. McKeown argued by residual analysis: neither personal health care\nnor public health appeared to have had much impact prior to the 1900s, when most\nof the mortality decline had already occurred. In a famous example, McKeown\nshowed that mortality from tuberculosis fell by 80 percent before there was any\neffective treatment for the disease. The same is true for other infectious diseases as\nwell. However, many analysts found unconvincing both McKeown's dismissal of\npublic health, as well as the argument by elimination that nutrition was the crucial\nfactor (for example, Szreter, 1988; Guha, 1994).\nDirect evidence on the role of nutrition in improved health and mortality\nreduction comes from the work of Robert Fogel, in a series of papers summarized\n\nThe Determinants of Mortality 101\nin Fogel (1997) and in his 2004 book. Fogel begins by showing the enormous\nincrease in caloric intake after the middle of the eighteenth century, measured\nboth directly from agricultural output and diary surveys, and indirectly through\nchanges in adult height. Between the middle of the eighteenth century and today,\nfor example, caloric intake per person increased by more than a third, and heights\nin most of Europe increased by ten centimeters or more (Fogel, 1994, Table 1).\nMortality is U-shaped in the body mass index (weight divided by height squared),\nand declines with height given the body mass index. Fogel (1997) uses these\nrelationships to argue that nearly all of the reduction in mortality from the late\neighteenth century to the late nineteenth century can be attributed to improved\nnutrition, as well as half of the mortality improvement in the century after that.\nBut the evidence on calorie availability has not convinced everyone. One line\nof argument is that the increase in life expectancy in England from 1750 to 1820\nhad nothing to do with increased income per head, but was just one of the\nfluctuations in mortality that characterized pre-industrial Europe. Indeed, Wrigley\nand Schofield (1981) estimate that life expectancy in 1600 was the same as in 1820,\nwith 1750 being the low point of a two-century swing. Steckel (2004) argues on the\nbasis of skeletal remains that people were taller (and presumably better nourished)\nin early medieval times. If we accept this argument and date the modern decrease\nin mortality from 1870, when it began in earnest in England and several other\nEuropean countries, the link between economic growth and mortality becomes\ntenuous, because the timing of the beginnings of modern growth is far more\ndispersed across countries than is the onset of the modern mortality decline\n(Easterlin, 2004). Also, as we shall see, improvements in public health offer a more\ncoherent explanation for mortality declines after 1870.\nAnother concern with the nutritional story is that, from the sixteenth to the\neighteenth centuries, English aristocrats had no life expectancy advantage over the\nrest of the population, despite presumably better nutrition. Moreover, mortality was\nnot lower in well-fed populations of the same period, such as in the United States\n(Livi-Bacci, 1991).\nFurther, there are powerful two-way interactions between disease and nutri-\ntion. Children who are frequently malnourished often continually suffer from\npoorly-controlled infectious disease. Diseases such as diarrhea prevent food intake\nfrom nourishing the body; children who suffer repeated episodes of diarrhea may\nbe able to digest less than 80 percent of what they consume (Dasgupta and Ray,\n1990). As a result, some argue that it was disease, not nutrition, that was the primary\nexogenous influence, and that disease burdens changed most strongly as a result of\npublic health intervention.\nPublic Health\nThe argument for the role of public health in reduced mortality is made most\nprominently by Samuel Preston (1975, 1980, 1996). If economic growth were the\nsole reason for improved health, countries would move along the “Preston curve”\nshown in Figure 1, but the curve itself would remain fixed. However, even at a given\n\n102 Journal of Economic Perspectives\nlevel of income, people live substantially longer today than they did in the past. For\nexample, China in 2000 has the income level of the United States in the 1880s, but\nhas the life expectancy of the United States in 1970—about 72 years. Preston\nestimates that only about 15 percent of the increase in life expectancy between the\n1930s and 1960s is a result of increases in income alone (Preston, 1975). While\nincome was certainly mismeasured historically, creating uncertainty in this esti-\nmate, there is no recorded income in 1930 that would have predicted the life\nexpectancy observed in many countries in 1960.\nPublic health improvements are an obvious explanation for this shift. Macro\npublic health involves big public works projects: filtering and chlorinating water\nsupplies, building sanitation systems, draining swamps, pasteurizing milk and un-\ndertaking mass vaccination campaigns. Micro public health involves changes made\nby individuals but encouraged by the public sector, including boiling bottles and\nmilk, protecting food from insects, washing hands, ventilating rooms and keeping\nchildren's vaccinations up to date. Macro public health was always present to some\nextent. Even in the Middle Ages, it was known that people living in areas where\nbubonic plague was rampant should be quarantined. (Unfortunately, rats were not\nquarantined.) Benjamin Latrobe built a water system in Philadelphia early in the\nnineteenth century, at least partly to reduce the disease burden. In 1854 John Snow\ncompared cholera fatalities between households supplied by two different water\ncompanies, one of which was recycling human waste, and one of which was not. He\nthus demonstrated that cholera was water-borne and that its spread could be halted\nby uncontaminated water supplies. But big public health did not fully come into its\nown until the acceptance of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s and 1890s,\nwhich led to a wave of new public health initiatives and the conveyance of safe\nhealth practices to individuals.\nThe dramatic reduction in water and food-borne diseases after that time—\ntyphoid, cholera, dysentery, and non-respiratory tuberculosis—highlights the role\nof public health. From a mortality rate of 214 per 100,000 in 1848–54, these\ndiseases were virtually eliminated in the United States by 1970. By one estimate,\nwater purification alone can explain half of the mortality reduction in the United\nStates in the first third of the twentieth century (Cutler and Miller, 2005).\nUrbanization\nIf rising living standards were good for health, urbanization was not, at least\ninitially. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that the lack of improvement\nin mortality between 1820 and 1870 was due in large part to the greater spread of\ndisease in newly enlarged cities. Nutrition may or may not be the culprit here;\ndebate about whether nutrition and real wages were rising or falling in the middle\nof the nineteenth century continues to rage. But the effect of unsanitary conditions\nwas larger and the spread of disease was easier in bigger, more crowded cities.\n\nDavid Cutler, Angus Deaton and Adriana Lleras-Muney 103\nVaccination\nPrior to the twentieth century, there was little effective medical treatment for\ninfectious disease. Over the course of the twentieth century, however, the role of\nmedical advances increased in importance.\nThe first important medical interventions were vaccinations. Variolation\nagainst smallpox, practiced in China as early as the tenth century, was an early form\nof immunization whereby matter from the scabs of previous victims was introduced\ninto the bodies of healthy people. Variolation was introduced to Europe from\nTurkey and to the American colonies by African slaves in the early eighteenth\ncentury. George Washington variolated his entire army. Vaccination was intro-\nduced by Edward Jenner at the end of the eighteenth century, but wide-scale\nresearch on vaccines depended on the germ theory of disease and did not occur\nuntil a century later. Since the late nineteenth century, there have been a number\nof new vaccines, including those for rabies (1885), plague (1897), diphtheria\n(1923), pertussis (1926), tuberculosis (1927), tetanus (1927), yellow fever (1935),\npolio (1955 and 1962), measles (1964), mumps (1967), rubella (1970), and hep-\natitis B (1981).\nThe morbidity consequences of these diseases were high, but the best available\nhistorical data suggest that, in the now-rich countries, direct mortality from these\ndiseases was relatively rare immediately prior to introduction of these vaccines, except\nfor tuberculosis. As many as half a million people contracted measles in the United\nStates just before the vaccine was developed, for example, but measles directly ac-\ncounted for fewer than 1,000 deaths. Exclusive of tuberculosis, reductions in these\ncauses of death account for only 3 percent of the total mortality reduction. The\nreduction in tuberculosis mortality is another 10 percent, but in the United States,\nunlike most other countries, the tuberculosis vaccine has never been routinely used, so\nnone of the reduction was due to vaccination. These conclusions parallel those of\nMcKeown; the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis was widely used in Britain, but without any\nevidence of an effect on trend mortality. Apart from polio, the same is true for the\nintroduction of other vaccines. Of course, the indirect consequences of eliminating\ninfectious diseases may be greater; people with measles may succumb more readily to\nother diseases, for example. Evidence suggests there are indirect mortality effects for\nsome water-born diseases (Cutler and Miller, 2005), but the extent of such indirect\neffects in the disease environment as a whole is not known.\nMedical Treatments\nQuantitatively more important for mortality was the development of new\ntherapeutics for people with disease. Figure 3 shows mortality for infectious diseases\nand cardiovascular disease. Infectious disease declined greatly in the first half of the\ncentury, while cardiovascular disease mortality reductions were particularly impor-\ntant after 1960.\nAntibiotics, developed in the 1930s and 1940s, were the first of the new wave\nof medical therapies. Sulfa drugs and penicillin were the wonder drugs of their era.\nBy 1960, mortality from infectious diseases had declined to its current level.\n\n104 Journal of Economic Perspectives\nFigure 3\nMortality From Infectious Disease and Cardiovascular Disease, United States,\n1900-2000\nInfectious disease (deaths per 100,000)\n300\nInfectious disease\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\nCardiovascular disease\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\nCardiovascular disease (deaths per 100,000)\n1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000\nSource: Data are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health\nStatistics, and are age adjusted.\nMore intensive medical interventions date in importance largely from the\npost-World War II era, and are associated with a different cause of mortality. Since\n1960, cardiovascular disease mortality has declined by over 50 percent, and cardio-\nvascular disease mortality reductions account for 70 percent of the seven-year\nincrease in life expectancy between 1960 and 2000. Cutler (2004) matches the\nresults of clinical trials to actual mortality declines, and attributes the bulk of the\ndecline in cardiovascular disease mortality—as much as two-thirds of the reduc-\ntion—to medical advance. Beyond medical advance, the major factor in reduced\ncardiovascular disease mortality is the reduction in smoking. Smoking rates in the\nUnited States have fallen to half their level at the time of the Surgeon General's\n1964 report on the harms of smoking. Continued public health campaigns against\ntobacco use have been an important part of this decline.\nAn additional 19 percent of the increase in life expectancy since 1960 is a result\nof reduced infant mortality. Cutler (2004) attributes a large share of continued\ninfant mortality reductions to improved neonatal medical care for low birth-weight\ninfants. The remainder of the decline in mortality since the 1960s includes reduced\nmortality from external causes, primarily motor vehicle accidents, reduced mortal-\nity from pneumonia/influenza, and a slight decrease in cancer mortality.\nThe importance of medical technology and smoking behavior can also be seen\nin the simultaneous decline and rapid convergence of mortality rates for all\ndeveloped countries, particularly for men, and particularly for cardiovascular dis-\nease.

Appel accentuated the prev-\nalence of the “photography theme” (141) in Nabokov's novels and the significance\nof visual images, which, in Appel's opinion, are indicative of his poetic reality.\nAppel questioned Nabokov about the relation between his visual sense and poetics,\ninquiring whether he had studied the science of optics. Nabokov answered that\n“even with the best of vision one must touch things to be quite sure of ‘reality”\n(141), affirming that one cannot grasp “reality” by mere optical perception. How-\never, Nabokov rejected Appel's inference that his own photography theme in Lolita\nreferenced Lewis Carroll's perverse hobby of taking pictures of semi-undressed lit-\ntle girls. This definite answer prevented Appel from further exploring the theme of\nvisual imagery in Nabokov's poetics, especially in Lolita. The photography theme is\nevident in this novel, but, like an overexposed image, it loses its sharpness due to its\nown prevalence. My task in this article is, in Nabokov's own words, to “eliminate all\nthe superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision," to\nsharpen the focus and create the “final picture” (Nabokov, Lolita 125) from these\noverexposed “images.”\n\nIndeed, photographic themes are abundant in Lolita, as are the themes of paint-\nerly art. Scholars have proposed many explanations for the themes of photography\nand paintings in Nabokov's poetics, particularly in Lolita. Gavriel Moses indicated\nthat in Nabokov's works the mechanisms of writing, memory, and the imagination\nare “akin to the mechanisms of photography and cinematography” (40). Karen\nJacobs suggested that a “photographic consciousness” in Lolita not only turns “the real into the simulacrum” but also performs “an elegiac function as a means of\nmarking the absence for which the image itself stands” (269). Gerard de Vries, Don-\nald B. Johnson, and Liana Aschenden reconstructed the four different paintings\nthat appeared in *Lolita* and argued that the paintings functioned “to reveal what\nis suppressed in Humbert's self-absorbed account: the sufferings of Dolly" (17). All\nthese studies provide a convincing account of the photographic and painterly\nthemes and perceptions in *Lolita*, but they do not explore the nature of these\nmodes of perception in the novel, namely, the accidental and deliberate distor-\ntion of reality involved in the artist's dilemma, the inability to see “the real”\nobject during the artistic creation.\n\nThis article compares two types of visual images in Nabokov's *Lolita*: photo-\ngraphic images created by the camera obscura and painterly images created by the\ncamera lucida. By taking up the camera obscura and camera lucida techniques from\nphotography and painting, respectively, this article aims to compare the two types\nof writing that appear in *Lolita*: writing a private diary and writing a manuscript for\npublication. Nabokov uses photography, which voyeuristically privatizes an exter-\nnal object by transforming it into a personal and internal image, as a metaphor for\nHumbert's pathological obsession. Later, this internalized image is converted into\nHumbert's subjective imagination, distorting his perception of objective reality. I\ndiscuss the analogy between the photographic image and Humbert's personal\ndiary later in the article. The painterly image, which functions as an exhibitionistic\nexternalization of personal perception and an objectification of furtive sensual\npleasures, refers to Humbert's manuscript itself, and serves as a “refuge” from\nthe inevitable mortality pursuing Humbert and Lolita.\n\nWhile comparing these two types of visual images, I argue that Humbert's pho-\ntographic perception of reality (the unconscious distortion of reality) and his paint-\nerly perception of reality (the intended distortion of reality) reveal Nabokov's view\non art: art has no relation to life, being, instead, the truthful representation of an\nartist's inspiration. This idea is based on my hypothesis that most of the artist-\ncharacters in Nabokov's works are faced with the dilemma during the process of\ncreation—to continue observing an object or to cease perceiving it in order to\ntransform their inspiration into an artwork. To substantiate this hypothesis, I\ndiscuss the inevitably accidental nature of photographic images, which register\na different image of the object from the one intended and observed by the pho-\ntographer. Then, I explain how a painter depicts life from his or her memory\nand—during the synthetic visualization of the painterly image—inevitably inte-\ngrates different images from different temporal-spatial contexts. Afterward, I\nargue that despite the apparent differences between these two forms of visual per-\nception, a Nabokovian artist inevitably fails to capture the full reality of the object;\nthe artist is seized by his or her own inspiration that has been derived from the\nobject but does not necessarily represent the object in its “true” form. Such inabil-\nity to perceive reality objectively leads Humbert, whom I consider as a hypothetical\nphotographer and painter in *Lolita*, to construct his own imaginative, simulated\nworld that has minimal reference to real life. Nabokov uses this artistic dilemma—\nthe mismatch between the artist's gaze and the observed object—to show Hum-\nbert's obsessive psyche; at the same time, I investigate how the dilemma also\nreveals Nabokov's own underlying quest to display the psyche of the artist, who unconsciously memorizes specific and perhaps even random aspects of things to\nlater consciously revive them modified almost to the point of nonrecognition, in\nhis or her artworks.\n\nHumbert's Photogenic Mother, Annabel, and Lolita: Simulacra\nof Nonexistence\n\nWhen Nabokov introduced his newly published novel *Lolita*, he announced it as a\n"story of a poor charming girl” (Shrayer 113). This is an apt description of the\nnovel, but we cannot help thinking that this novel is also about Humbert Hum-\nbert's perception of that girl. After finishing the novel, readers understand that\nthey should have been aware of the writer's photographic maneuvers to depict a\n“poor” model as a sirenic figure, a photographic object that has nothing in common\nwith the actual model. Despite the writer's concise summary of *Lolita* as a “story of a\npoor charming girl," the readers see not the actual girl but rather her visual simu-\nlacrum through the aperture of Humbert's eyes, a simulacrum that constantly\ndeters Humbert (and the readers of his manuscript as well) from approaching\nthe physical body of Dolores Haze. The novel itself can be defined as a photograph\nof Dolores, captured by the focalizer Humbert.\n\nThere are certain passages from Humbert's childhood that provide a rationale for\nus to look at Humbert's aberrant perception of reality. These childhood moments\nare primarily related to photographic images and snapshots, which Humbert once\nowned. They play a crucial role in the development of Humbert's imaginative per-\nception.\n\nThe first picture is the picture of Humbert's mother. Humbert's “very photogenic\nmother" (Nabokov, *Lolita* 10) died when he was three; therefore, Humbert, as he\nconfessed, did not remember his mother, and the “memory” of his mother's warmth\nwas elicited solely by her photograph. From the beginning of the novel, we can\nobserve Humbert's proclivity to create simulacra of nonexistent persons and to\nimagine or memorize things that do not exist. A close correlation between mem-\nory and imagination was proclaimed by Nabokov himself, who considered imag-\nination to be “a form of memory” and assumed that imagination “is supplied and\nprompted by memory” (Appel 140). In the case of Humbert's mother, however,\nit was the photograph that invigorated Humbert's imagination: imaginative\n“furry warmth, golden midges” were laid over “the hollows and dells of memory”\n(Nabokov, *Lolita* 10). No one can prove whether this imagined memory has any-\nthing to do with reality. The only thing that can be substantiated is the fact that\nhis mother's photograph, or her image in it, filled the sterile hollows of Humbert's\nmemory with unexperienced warmth.\n\nThe second picture is related to Humbert's adolescent interests. Before his thir-\nteenth birthday, Humbert met an American boy, who, analogously to Humbert,\nrarely saw his mother “in the three-dimensional world” (11) and knew his mother,\nan actress, mostly through her motion pictures. Humbert and his American double\nsupplemented the lack of maternal caresses not only with the images of their moth-\ners framed in pictures but also with “a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk\nabout pubertal surprises” (11), which might have incited Humbert to look for sala-\ncious photographs. These photographs enhanced Humbert's imaginative power. While looking at these photographs “with partings,” his visual admiration trans-\nformed parting, or physical absence, into tactile delight: “infinitely soft partings"\n(11). The tactile impression gained without the involvement of corporeality later\ndevelops into Humbert's scopophilic dominance over Lolita because, according\nto Susan Sontag, every “photograph gives control over the thing photographed"\n(122) at least for the things that a photographer intended to include in his or her\nphotographs.\nThe last picture from his childhood is a snapshot with Annabel. This photograph\nwas taken a few minutes before Humbert and Annabel made their “final attempt to\nthwart fate" (Nabokov, Lolita 13). The image of “partings” captured in the salacious\nphotographs and Humbert's tactile perception of them are now transferred to the\nphysical parting in Annabel's hair: “And her thin bare shoulders and the parting in\nher hair were about all that could be identified (as I remember that picture) amid\nthe sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded” (13). It seems as if Humbert\napproaches closer and closer to the body of his beloved; however, he again fails to\n“possess” that “body”—the only thing that he could possess was Annabel's snap-\nshot. The theme of absence that began with the mother's photograph continues\nwith Annabel's snapshot. The snapshot demonstrates Humbert's desire for the\nunattainable person, for absence. Humbert treasured Annabel's snapshot until\nhe lost it during his wanderings; thus, he had to compensate for the lost memory\nwith a new picture: “this nouvelle, this Lolita, my Lolita, was to eclipse completely\nher prototype” (40). What is important here is that Humbert's unrealized desires\nwere transferred through optic images.\nAll three pictures, if we borrow the words of Cincinnatus from Invitation to a\nBeheading, “gravitated passionately toward a kind of perfection whose definition\nwas absence of friction” (50). The granular surface of reality is glossed over in pho-\ntographs, leaving only an ideal vestige of said reality in glazed snapshots. Humbert\nfollows Cincinnatus: he projects that perfection depicted in photographic images\nonto the real world, overlaying the real world with the hypothetical perfection. I\nsuggest that looking at the real world through photographs, or idealized images,\nis the crux of Humbert's imagination.\nIt seems that Nabokov deliberately employs photographic motifs to explore the\nrelation between reality and memory. What is the source of this photographic motif\nin Nabokov's poetics? I strongly doubt that Nabokov studied the science of optics,\nseeing that he did not answer Appel's question clearly; rather, I suppose that\nNabokov, being an aesthete, might have studied aesthetic theory that specifically\ntreated memory as a camera. Among many possible candidates, including Marcel\nProust and Henri Bergson, I propose Andrei Bely (1880–1934) as a potential influ-\nence on Nabokov's view that photography and memory share the same structure. Bely's standpoint is amazingly close to Nabokov's. He believed that the task of a\nwriter was to be responsible for the photograph inscribed in his or her heart: “за\nфотографию душевных нюансов ручаюсь: они напечатаны в сердце” (Bely, Sobranie\nsochinenii 56; I vouch for the photograph of emotional nuances: they are printed on\nthe heart).2 Both Bely and Nabokov were drawn to this inner experience. One could\nfind more similarities between Bely and Nabokov by discussing Bely's theory of\nSymbolism in detail, but, for now, I would like to leave this task for another work\nand focus on how Nabokov uses photography in his work Lolita.\n\nThe Photographic Image: An Accidental Representation of Reality\nIn this section, I explain the dual structure of cameras in general, which consists\nof two structures: a camera obscura and a perceptive device. Then, I discuss the four\ndifferent specificities of photographic vision caused by this dual structure. The first\nspecificity of photographic perception is the inability to see objects during expo-\nsure, which evokes the aforementioned problem of choice: to observe the object\nthrough the viewfinder, or to stop watching it and press the shutter button. Even\nif a photographer uses a rangefinder camera to see the object during exposure,\na common technique from the 1930s to the 1970s, the photographer sees the object\nfrom the wrong angle due to the parallax error inherent in this mechanism. By\ndeciding to take a picture, a photographer loses his or her ability to see the object\nand, thus, loses the visual connection with the object. The second specificity of pho-\ntographic perception is the fact that the photographic image is the brightest image\ncreated in the darkest place. I connect this contrast between the outside and the\ninside with the voyeuristic nature of photographic vision. Third, a photographer\ninevitably privatizes the image of the object. The object now becomes the photog-\nrapher's creation, a creation that has nothing to do with the actual object. Fourth, a\nphotograph is an inverted image of an exterior object. Such distortive nature of\nsimilar to how photography defines the father-daughter relationship in Lolita (I discuss this later in the\narticle). Nabokov depicted Bely in the novel The Gift. Bely's image emerges dimly throughout the novel.\nNabokov even dined behind Bely in Berlin, 1922. Bely was a painter, poet, novelist, and memoirist like\nNabokov himself. Bely, like Nabokov, proposed that art is a vehicle to personal immortality. Indeed, Bely\nfrequently associated his aesthetic standpoint with photography. He specifically referred to the camera\nbrand "Kodak” to show how he, while writing a memoir, wanted to “snap several times (nashchelkat')" the\nscenery, "develop (proiavit')" those shots later using his memory, and, if needed, “retouch (retush)” them:\n"...я старался быть «кодаком» и нащелкать ряд моментальных снимков, чтобы потом проявить памятью; и\nтеперь вижу, что ретуш необходим; но я к июлю проработаю все" (Bely, Andrei Bely 180). Of course, the\nword "kodak” and its verbal form “kodakirovat” were widely used in Russia at that time as synonyms of\n“fotografiia" and "fotografirovat.” However, Bely's use of photographic terms, such as “to snap," "to\ndevelop,” and “to retouch,” is indicative of how his aesthetic standpoint as a memoirist was related to\nthat of the camera. Bely's debut work, the "Symphony (the Second, Dramatic)” (1902), already contained\nrudimentary ideas about photographic truthfulness and photographic memorization. On Whit Monday\nin 1901, when Bely was finishing the second chapter of his second "Symphony," he had a chance to read his\nmanuscript to Sergei Soloviev, who was surprised by the close resemblance of the weather depicted in the\n"Symphony" (also on Whit Monday) to the actual weather of that day. In The Beginning of the Century\n(1933), Bely recollected this memory and stated that it was not surprising because he “photographed\nthe weather" of that day and wrote the "Symphony" at once in 24 hours: “. . . ведь погоду я сфотографир-\nовал, написал вторую часть чуть не в двадцать четыре часа" (Bely, Nachalo Veka 140). Here, Bely refers not to\nan actual photograph, but to his vivid memory and to his ability to immediately transcribe it on paper.\nReferring to his memory as a photograph implies that Bely as an artist attempted to take hypothetical\npictures of an object and then to render these pictures truthfully in his works.\n2 The translation is mine. photographic vision is indicative of Humbert's distortive memory. After analyzing\nthese specificities in detail, I compare them with Humbert's vision and discuss how\nthe specificities explain Humbert's obsessive appropriation of Dolores.\nBefore proceeding to compare the light-capturing technique used in photogra-\nphy and Humbert's psyche, it is critical to define the word camera. In Latin, camera\noriginally meant a vaulted room, a chamber, or a round building. Later, this word\nwas used to refer to a device that records visual images because every camera had a\ndark room, or a camera obscura. As the etymology of the word suggests, the word\ncamera combines two different devices: a camera obscura, which collects light from\noutside, and a perceptive device, which imprints that light onto a light-sensitive\nfilm/plate. The camera obscura is a dark cubic device with an aperture for letting\nin light from an external object that reproduces an inverted image of said external\nobject. Plato's cave, according to Sontag's analogy, was the most ancient (though\nimaginary) form of a camera obscura. Our eyes also function like a camera obscura:\nthe light from an outer object reaches the retina of the human eye, leaving an\ninverted image of that object. This innate inversion in the organ of vision, I argue,\nimplies a subjective (but unintended) distortion of objective reality.\nThe identification of human vision with an optical device can be found through-\nout Nabokov's literary works as well. Appel drew a parallel between one's visual\nsense and the science of optics in Nabokov's works, asserting that “consciousness\nis virtually an optical instrument” (141). In his novel Laughter in the Dark, originally\nentitled Camera Obscura, Nabokov himself associated the camera obscura with the\nhuman eyes, vision, and people's subjective perceptions of the outer world. In the\nnovel, after Albinus is blinded, Margot describes all the colors to him, making Albi-\nnus feel that he can see his surroundings. However, this sense of security is decep-\ntive, as Margot, incited by Rex, has “changed all the colours” (167) while describing\nthe furniture, the blinds, and the wallpaper. The situation was not completely differ-\nent when Albinus could actually see things—he could not see the intimate relation-\nship between Margot and Rex. Human vision, like a camera obscura, is merely a sub-\njective distortion of reality. Thus, when I use the term “Humbert's camera obscura,”\nI am primarily referring to Humbert's vision, or the internalized image of the outer\nworld, whereas a perceptive device, which fixates the light from an outer object on\na light-sensitive film and forms a simulacrum of it, relates to the imagination.\nThe reason why I distinguish one's vision (or experiencing an image) from its\nimprint on a surface (or remembering/manipulating the image, that is, imagina-\ntion) is not only because the former signifies instant experience while the latter sig-\nnifies the prolonged memory of that experience but also because of the two differ-\nent processes of capturing an image in photography. Regarding this issue, Roland\nBarthes made a keen observation in Camera Lucida:\nTechnically, Photography is at the intersection of two quite distinct procedures; one of a chemical order:\nthe action of light on certain substances; the other of a physical order: the formation of the image\nthrough an optical device. It seemed to me that the Spectator's Photograph descended essentially, so to\nspeak, from the chemical revelation of the object (from which I receive, by deferred action, the rays), and\nthat the Operator's Photograph, on the contrary, was linked to the vision framed by the keyhole of the\ncamera obscura. (10)\nBarthes distinguishes the Spectator's photograph from the Operator's photograph.\nThe Spectator's photograph is the result of the chemical imprint of the object's light,\nwhereas the Operator's photograph is a visually framed image in the camera obscura. This statement suggests that the final picture, which the Spectator looks at, may not\nrepresent the primordial image perceived by the photographer. The congruity of\nan image is mechanically dissected by the camera structure itself. A mirror, which\nallows us to view an object from the same angle as the lens, blocks the path of light\nwhen the shutter exposes the film. Thus, every picture is a result of the following\nchoice: to continue looking at an object through a camera's viewfinder or to waive\nthe privilege of watching and trust that a light-sensitive film will record the invisible-\nto-the-eye randomness of an object.\nThis photographic feature reveals the first specificity of Humbert's photographic\nperception: the inability to observe the object during the moment of exposure.\nHumbert elucidates two different types of visual memory and explains that he\ncan see Lolita only “with shut eyes.” The following description reminds us of the\naforementioned two ways of inscribing images:\nThere are two kinds of visual memory: one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of\nyour mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in such general terms as: “honey-colored\nskin,” “thin arms,” “brown bobbed hair,” “long lashes,” “big bright mouth"); and the other when you\ninstantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark innerside of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical rep-\nlica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors (and this is how I see Lolita). (Nabokov, Lolita 11)\nIn this quote, Humbert discusses two different visual memories by distinguishing\ntwo different processes of making memories. The first kind of visual memory oper-\nates simultaneously with vision. It is more closely connected with the long process of\npainting and representing the image—a camera lucida—while the second kind of\nvisual memory operates with eyes closed, as in photography. The inability to see the\nobject during the moment of exposure is an unavoidable phenomenon in photog-\nraphy. Humbert regards Lolita as a photographic object. Though he is trying to see\nher, his eyes are shut, and he sees only “a little ghost” (11), a perfect “eidolon emitted\nby the object" (Barthes 9). Every time he looks at Dolores, he is actually taking a\npicture of her, trying to grasp her gossamer-like specter—that is, Lolita: “I would\nlike to describe her face, her ways—and I cannot, because my own desire for her\nblinds me when she is near. I am not used to being with nymphets, damn it. If I close\nmy eyes I see but an immobilized fraction of her, a cinematographic still, a sudden\nsmooth nether loveliness, as with one knee up under her tartan skirt she sits tying\nher shoe” (44). I doubt that Humbert's desire for Lolita is a straightforward sexual\ndesire. Rather, it is the desire to fantasize about her. In Humbert's own words, it is\nhis internal sin, his “delectatio morosa,” which I see as the replication of Humbert's\nlove for absence. Humbert fails to achieve the weaker desire to describe “her\nface, her ways” in motion because of the delectatio morosa, or, if we borrow Barth-\nes's photographic notion, because of the punctum of the photogenic Lolita,\nwhich is revealed every time he closes his eyes. The punctum, according to\nBarthes, is revealed only when the actual object—in this case Lolita—“is no lon-\nger in front of me and I think back on it” (Barthes 53). Humbert's weaker, painterly\ndesire to describe Lolita's face and ways in motion is merely an insignificant effort\nthat "will always miss its point of effect” (Barthes 53). This photographic specificity\ncoincides with the process of diary writing, which Humbert revitalizes “by cour-\ntesy of a photographic memory” (Nabokov, Lolita 40). He could reproduce his\noriginal diary even five years after the original was destroyed because the most\nimpressive imagery, or the punctum, was registered in his memory. Moreover, Hum-\nbert's diary represents a palimpsest: “First I jotted down each entry in pencil (with many erasures and corrections) on the leaves of what is commercially known as a\n'typewriter tablet'; then, I copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smallest,\nmost satanic, hand in the little black book just mentioned” (40). The diary captures\nthe initial experience and then fixates that experience with the help of memory.\nOnly his memory can revive the “obvious abbreviations” written by his “most\nsatanic” hand. This twofold process recalls Humbert's two kinds of visual memory.\nThe second specificity of photographic perception is the fact that a photograph\nis the brightest image created in the darkest place. Every camera has its camera\nobscura. The light from the object comes through the lens, leaving its simulacrum\nwithin the camera obscura. This process resembles how Humbert perceives Dolores:\n“In the course of the sun-shot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling\nchild ... while I passed by her in my adult disguise . . . the vacuum of my soul man-\naged to suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these I checked against the\nfeatures of my dead bride. A little later, of course, she, this nouvelle, this Lolita, my\nLolita, was to eclipse completely her prototype” (39–40). The way in which Hum-\nbert is absorbing Dolores's brightness is reminiscent of how pictures are made. She\nis "a photographic image rippling upon a screen” (62) while the vacuum of Hum-\nbert's soul is the analogue of a photographic film. Now, this new picture of Lolita\nreplaces the old, lost picture of Annabel. Furthermore, the opposition of brightness\nand darkness is expanded to the chronotopical value system. Humbert used to\nobserve Dolores from a vantage point, from a window of the dark bathroom on\nthe second floor, a structure that is similar to that of a pinhole camera. The oppo-\nsition between the outside and the inside is intensified by the opposition between a\nflourishing garden and a tiny secluded bathroom. One could describe it as a Hum-\nbertized Plato's cave. This specificity overlaps again with Humbert's diary writing.\nThe first day recounted in his diary takes place in this very bathroom, with Humbert\nobserving Dolores in the garden. Humbert's diary had registered the brightest\nimpression of the nymphet, and ironically, the original diary came into existence\nbecause of the observations made in the tiny bathroom, or in the camera obscura. As\nChristina Tekiner noted in “Time in Lolita,” if we look at Lolita from the vantage\npoint of the whole narrative discourse, Humbert is rewriting his diary, most pre-\nsumably, in his prison cell, like his prototype Cincinnatus. Incarcerated in a double\ndark room, the bathroom and the actual prison, Humbert relives a doubled mem-\nory: the memory of Lolita and the memory of the first memory of Lolita. The first\nmemory is written for his own pleasure, whereas the second is for the immortality of\nhim and Lolita. The motif of double distortion and the doubled memory re-present\nthe idea that art represents or distorts an artist's ability to reflect on a real object but\ndoes not present the object per se. Nabokov laconically expresses this in The Eye:\n"For I do not exist: there exist but the thousands of mirrors that reflect me” (103).\nThe third specificity of photographic perception is the fact that a photographer\ninevitably privatizes the image of an object. As discussed before, the vision of the\nOperator differs from the Spectator's photograph because the Operator's vision can-\nnot be imprinted onto a photograph. A photograph is merely an unintended rep-\nresentation of the Operator's vision at a different temporal point. Thus, a photogra-\npher is the only one who possesses his or her initial vision of an object. Furthermore,\nit is not only the Operator's vision that privatizes the image of an object.

There is no one around and nothing\nin sight except the sand. I, too, am naked, barefoot, dumbfounded\nby everything around me. I can feel the sand under my feet and a\ncool wind. I move slowly toward the bench. When and why has she\ncome back after all these years? Her long black hair is piled about\nher head. A few locks cover her right cheek, as if guarding her face,\nwhich has not changed with the years. Her eyebrows are carefully\nplucked, and her eyelids, which end in thick eyelashes, are shut.\nHer nose guards her lips, which bear pink lipstick as if she were still\nalive. Her nipples are erect; there is no trace of the surgery. Her\nhands are clasped over her navel; her fingernails and toenails are\npainted the same pink as her lipstick. Her pubic hair is shaved.\nI wonder whether she is asleep or dead. I am afraid to touch her. I\nlook into her face and whisper her name, “Reem.” She smiles, her\neyes still shut at first. Then she opens them, and the blackness in her\npupils smiles as well. I can't grasp what is going on. I ask in a loud\nvoice, “Reem, what are you doing here?"\nI am about to hug and kiss her, but she warns me: “Don't kiss me.\nWash me first so we can be together and then . . . ”\n"What? You are still alive?"\n“Wash me so we can be together. I missed you so much.”\n“But you are not dead!"\n“Wash me, darling . . . Wash me so we can be together.”\n“With what? There is nothing here."\n"Wash me, darling."\n1 Raindrops begin to fall, and she closes her eyes. I wipe a drop off\nher nose with my index finger. Her skin is warm, which means she is\nalive. I start to caress her hair. I will wash her with the rain, I think.\nShe smiles as if she'd heard my thought. Another drop settles above\nher left eyebrow. I wipe it off.\nI think I hear a car approaching. I turn around and see a Humvee\ndriving at an insane speed, leaving a trail of flying dust. It suddenly\nswerves to the right and comes to a stop a few meters away from us. Its\ndoors open. Masked men wearing khaki uniforms and carrying ma-\nchine guns rush toward us. I try to shield Reem with my right hand,\nbut one of the men has already reached me. He hits me in the face\nwith the stock of his machine gun. I fall to the ground. He kicks me in\nthe stomach. Another starts dragging me away from the washing\nbench. None of them says a word. I am screaming and cursing them,\nbut I can't hear myself. Two men force me to get down on my knees\nand tie my wrists with a wire behind my back. One of them puts a\nknife to my neck; the other blindfolds me. I try to run away, but they\nhold me tightly. I scream again, but cannot hear my screams. I hear\nonly Reem's shrieks, the laughter and grunts of the men, the sound of\nthe rain.\nI feel a sharp pain, then the cold blade of the knife penetrating\nmy neck. Hot blood spills over my chest and back. My head falls to\nthe ground and rolls like a ball on the sand. I hear footsteps. One of\nthe men takes off my blindfold and shoves it into his pocket. He spits\nin my face and goes away. I see my body to the left of the bench,\nkneeling in a puddle of blood.\nThe other men return to the Humvee, two of them dragging\nReem by her arms. She tries to turn her head back in my direction,\nbut one of them slaps her. I cry out her name but can't hear my\nvoice. They put her in the back seat and shut the door. The engine\nstarts. The Humvee speeds away and disappears over the horizon.\nThe rain keeps falling on the empty bench.\nI woke up panting and sweating. I wiped my forehead and face. The\nsame nightmare had been recurring for weeks, with minor changes.\n2 Sometimes I saw Reem's severed head on the bench and heard her\nvoice saying, "Wash me, darling,” but this was the first time there\nwas rain. It must have slipped into my dream from outdoors. I could\nhear drops on the window next to my bed.\nI looked at my watch. It was already 3:30 A.M.\nI've slept only three hours after a long and grueling day. I am\nworn out.\nDeath is not content with what it takes from me in my waking\nhours, it insists on haunting me even in my sleep. Isn't it enough\nthat I toil all day tending to its eternal guests, preparing them to\nsleep in its lap? Is death punishing me because I thought I could\nescape its clutches? If my father were still alive he would mock my\nsilly thoughts. He would dismiss all this as infantile, unbecoming to\na man. Didn't he spend a lifetime doing his job day after day, never\nonce complaining of death? But death back then was timid and\nmore measured than today.\nI can almost hear death saying: “I am what I am and haven't\nchanged at all. I am but a postman.”\nIf death is a postman, then I receive his letters every day. I am the\none who opens carefully the bloodied and torn envelopes. I am the\none who washes them, who removes the stamps of death and dries\nand perfumes them, mumbling what I don't entirely believe in.\nThen I wrap them carefully in white so they may reach their final\nreader-the grave.\nBut letters are piling up, Father! Tenfold more than what you used\nto see in the span of a week now pass before me in a day or two. If you\nwere alive, Father, would you say that that is fate and God's will? I\nwish you were here so I could leave Mother with you and escape\nwithout feeling guilty. You were heavily armed with faith, and that\nmade your heart a castle. My heart, by contrast, is an abandoned\nhouse whose windows are shattered and doors unhinged. Ghosts\nplay inside it, and the winds wail.\nAs a child, I would cover my head with a second pillow to block\nout noise. I look for it now; it has fallen by the bed next to my\nslippers. I pick it up and bury my head under it in order to reclaim\n3 my share of the night. The image of Reem being dragged away by\nher hair keeps returning.\nReem hadn't been at the heart of my nightmare until a few weeks\nago. Where was she now? I heard a few years ago that she was in\nAmsterdam. I'll Google her again tomorrow when I go to the Inter-\nnet café after work. I'll try a different spelling of her name in English\nand maybe I'll find something. But can I just grab a bit of sleep for\nan hour or two?\n4 TWO\nI stood next to my mother on the steps in front of the big\nwooden door. Her right hand firmly clasped my right hand, as if I\nwere about to run or fly away. Her left hand carried the sufurtas in\nwhich she packed my father's lunch-three small copper pots, each\nstacked on top of the other in a metal skeleton resembling a little\nmetal building. The top pot was filled with rice. The middle one\nwith okra stew and two pieces of meat. The lower pot usually had\nsome fruit. That day she'd put in a tiny bunch of white grapes, the\nkind we call "goat nipples," that my father liked. There was a warm\nloaf of homemade bread in the nylon sack dangling from her left\nwrist. She put her left foot on the steps and temporarily released my\nhand to knock four times. Her strong knocks pushed the door open.\nShe pretended not to see the young man squatting a few steps away\nfrom the door with his back to the wall. He was wearing black. His\nhead was buried in his hands and he looked like he was wailing.\nSmoke rose from the cigarette in his left hand. That was the first\ntime I'd seen a grown man cry.\nI looked into my mother's coffee-colored eyes. In a hushed voice,\nI asked, "Why is this man crying?"\nShe put her index finger on her lips to shush me and whispered,\n“Don't be rude, Jawad!"\nI craned to the left, curious to see what was happening inside. It\nwas the first time my mother had taken me to my father's place of\nwork. He usually took the sufurtas with him in the morning, but that\nday he had forgotten to bring it along.\nThe narrow walkway led to a wide room with a high ceiling.\n5 Three or four men were standing at its entrance with their backs\nblocking the scene. Were they watching my father as he worked?\nThe street was quiet and although the walkway was long, I could\nhear the sound of water being spilled, with my father's voice mutter-\ning phrases I couldn't understand, except for the word "God."\nMy mother knocked at the open door with more force and deter-\nmination this time and then called out “Hammoudy.” None of the\nmen turned around. Then the one standing to the far left moved\naside and Hammoudy's face appeared. He limped to the door. Ham-\nmoudy, my father's assistant, looked older than his actual age. He\nhad black hair and eyelashes as thick as a paint brush. He wore blue\nshorts and a white T-shirt which was wet in many spots. After ex-\nchanging a quick hello, my mother gave him the sufurtas and the\nbread saying: "Here, Hammoudy, this is Abu Ammoury's lunch. He\nforgot to take it.”\nHe thanked her and rushed back inside after shutting the door.\nShe held my hand again and we started to make our way back\nhome. I turned back to look at the squatting man. His head was still\nin his hands. My mother shook me and said, “Mind where you're\ngoing. You're going to trip and fall."\nAt that age I didn't know much about my father's work. All I knew\nwas that he was a mghassilchi, a body-washer, but this word was\nobscure to me. I was afraid that day and asked my mother: “Does\nFather hurt people?"\n“No son, not at all. It's quite the opposite. Why do you ask?"\n"But wasn't that man there crying?"\n"Yes, but not because of your father. He's just sad."\n“Why is he sad? What are they doing inside?"\n"Your dad washes the bodies of the dead. It's a very honorable\nprofession and those who do it are rewarded by God."\n"Why does he wash them? Are they dirty?"\n“No, but they must be purified."\n"And where do the dead go after they die?"\n"To God. Your father tends to them before they are buried."\n“How can they go to God if they are buried?”\n6 “The soul rises to the sky, but the body remains in the earth it\ncame from. It is said that we are come from Adam and Adam is of\ndust."\nI looked up to the sky. There were five clouds huddled together\nand I wondered: Which one will carry the dead man's soul? Where\nwill it take it?\n7 THREE\nThe only time I ever saw my father cry was many years later\nwhen he heard that my brother Ameer, whom we called Ammoury,\nhad died. Ameer, who was five years my senior, was transformed\nfrom "Doctor” into “Martyr.” His framed black-and-white photo-\ngraph occupied the heart of the main wall in our living room and\neven a bigger part of my father's heart, which Ammoury had already\nmonopolized. Ameer, you see, was the ideal son who had always\nmade my father proud. He always excelled and was the top of his\nclass. At the national baccalaureate exams, his score was 95 percent,\nwhich enabled him to go to medical school to study to become a\nsurgeon. Ameer wanted to fulfill his dream of opening a clinic so he\ncould allow Father to retire. Father insisted that he would keep\nworking until he died. Ameer insisted on helping Father at work\neven on his short leaves from the army during the years of war with\nIran. This was before he was killed in the al-Faw battles.\nI was reading in my room on the second floor when I heard a car\nstop in front of the house and doors being slammed shut. Seconds\nlater, I heard the new doorbell ringing—the doorbell Ameer had\nbought and installed after the old one had stopped working and I\nhad procrastinated about fixing it. I drew the curtain open and saw a\ntaxi with a flag-draped coffin on top of it. My heart sunk into an\nabyss.\nWhenever I saw a taxi driving down the street with a flag-draped\ncoffin on it, the thought would cross my mind that Ammoury might\none day return like this, but I would quickly cast the vision aside. I\nrushed down the stairs barefoot. When I reached the front door my\n8	2025-01-03 20:10:56.781556	2025-01-03 20:10:56.781559	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf- Sinan Antoon - The Corpse Washer (beginning)-2614", "chunks_count": 5}

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far\n\naway, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote\n\ngrey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.\n\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning\n\nhad sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!\n\nWith that he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-\n\nbearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder.\n\nAnd straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in\n\nmusic, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour\n\nwas like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the\n\nmountains.\n\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!\n\nSuddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang\n\naway. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse\n\nupon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Eomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his\n\nspeed, and the front of the first e ored roared like a breaker\n\nfoaming to the shore, but Theoden could not be overtaken.\n\nFey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new\n\nfire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a\n\ngod of old, even as Orome ¨ the Great in the battle of the Valar\n\nwhen the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered,\n\nand lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed\n\ninto green about the white feet of his steed.

KIP VISCUSI\nNew York Oxford\nOXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS\n1992\n\n9\nRisk within Reason¹\n9.1 INTRODUCTION\nSociety's system for managing risks to life and limb is deeply flawed. We overreact\nto some risks and virtually ignore others. Often too much weight is placed on risks\nof low probability but high salience (such as those posed by trace carcinogens or\nterrorist action); risks of commission rather than omission; and risks, such as those\nassociated with frontier technologies, whose magnitude is difficult to estimate. Too\nlittle effort is spent ameliorating voluntary risks, such as those involving auto-\nmobiles and diet. When the bearers of risk do not share in the costs of reduction,\nmoreover, extravagance is likely.\nPart of the problem is that we rely on a mix of individual, corporate, and\ngovernment decisions to respond to risk. Our traditional coordinating mecha-\nnisms-markets and government action-are crippled by inadequate information,\ncostly decision-making processes, and the need to accommodate citizens' misper-\nceptions, sometimes arising from imbalances in media attention.\nRisk can never be entirely eliminated from life, and reductions come at a price (in\ndollars, foregone pleasures, or both). Our current muddled approach makes it diffi-\ncult to reach wise, well-informed decisions as to the preferred balance of risk and\ncost. Some risks we ignore; some small ones we regulate stringently. Worse, our\noverreaction to very small risks impedes the kind of technological progress that has\nhistorically brought dramatic improvements in both health and material well-being.\nIn addition, we are likely to misdirect our efforts, for example, by focusing on risks\nthat command attention in the political process, such as newly identified car-\ncinogens, rather than those where the greatest gains in well-being are available,\nsuch as individual life-style choices.2\nOur regulatory efforts focus too much on equipment and physical processes, too\nlittle on human error and venality. We may set stringent emission standards, which\nimpose high costs per unit of environmental quality gained, yet ignore the haphaz-\nard operation of nuclear weapons plants.\nEvidently willing to expend substantial resources to reduce risk, our society\nseems reluctant to look closely at the bargains it has struck. Unless we reorient our\nrisk-management policies, we will continue to pay more than we should for health\ngains that are less than we could achieve.\nThe success of risk-management policies should be judged in terms of their effect\non expected utility. 3 In practice, the choices made by human beings under uncertain-\n()\n\n150\nRisk Regulation\nty frequently do not conform to the prescriptions of expected utility theory. Upon\nreflection, however, most people would accept the theory's axiomatic underpin-\nnings. (There is no well-developed competing prescriptive theory for choice under\nuncertainty.)\nThe formulation of risk policy should then begin by asking what outcomes would\nresult from perfectly functioning market processes if individuals behaved so as to\nmaximize their own expected utility. What level of adverse side effects from phar-\nmaceuticals would be acceptable if we knew the risk and could take the time and\neffort to make sound decisions? Our hypothetical market should be open to future\ngenerations. If they could compensate the present generation for preserving re-\nsources and the environment, what environmental decisions would we make today?\nSuch a thought experiment should guide our efforts to bequeath posterity an efficient\nmix of technological capabilities, environmental quality, and cultural attainments.\n9.2 HUMAN FALLIBILITY IN RESPONSES TO RISKS\nDecisions involving risks illustrate the limits of human rationality, as a substantial\nrecent literature documents. 4 Perhaps the most fundamental problem is that individ-\nuals have great difficulty comprehending extremely low-probability events, such as\ndifferentiating a risk of 10-7 from a risk 100 times as large, 10-5. When assessing\nsuch risks, even scientists may not appreciate how much greater the payoff is that\ncomes from addressing the larger probability.\nThe numerous decision-making problems that arise with respect to small proba-\nbilities are individually of little consequence. Expected welfare loss from any single\nerror may well be negligible. Aggregated, however, low-probability events make up\na large part of an individual's risk level. Even truly substantial risks, such as the\nchance of death from a stroke-roughly 1/2,000 annually averaged over the\npopulation-are usually influenced by a myriad of decisions, each of which has\nonly a small probabilistic impact on our longevity. Systematic errors in these deci-\nsions might have an enormous cumulative effect.\nMistakes in Estimation\nWhereas people generally overestimate the likelihood of low-probability events\n(death by tornado), they underestimate higher risk levels (heart disease or stroke).5\nWe are particularly likely to overestimate previously unrecognized risks in the\naftermath of an unfavorable outcome. Such perceptional biases account for the\nemotional public response to such events as Three Mile Island, or occasional inci-\ndents of deliberate poisoning of foodstuffs or medicines.\nRisk perceptions may also be affected by the visibility of a risk, by fear associated\nwith it, and by the extent to which individuals believe they can exercise control over\nit. Consider the greenhouse effect. Although global warming is a prime concern of\nthe Environmental Protection Agency, it ranks only twenty-third among the U.S.\npublic's environmental concerns.7 The high risk of automobile fatality-car acci-\ndents kill one in 5,000 Americans each years-might perhaps be reduced signifi-\n\nRisk within Reason\n151\ncantly if drivers informed with a more realistic sense of what they can and cannot do\nto control the risk drank less alcohol and wore seat belts more often.\nBecause experience tells us little about low-probability risks, we appropriately\nexamine correlated indicators that pose less serious problems. For example, the\nrecord high temperatures of 1988 may or may not have been signals of an impending\ngreenhouse effect. Unfortunately, such signals are seldom as informative as can-\naries in the coal mine. Adverse events may occur without warning; witness the San\nFrancisco earthquake in October 1989. Moreover, happenstance warnings may bear\nlittle relation to the magnitude, likelihood, or nature of a problem. Forest manage-\nment efforts should not have to await the chance burning of national parks and\nforests.\nDistortions in Monetary Valuation\nEconomic valuations of risk also tend to be distorted by underlying misweighting of\nrisks. For example, from an expected utility perspective, individuals generally place\ntoo high a value on preventing increases in a risk from its current level (the so-called\nstatus quo bias or reference risk effect. 10 These tendencies are reflected in govern-\nment policy. Products causing new forms of cancer tend to arouse greater public\nconcern, and new technologies are often regulated much more strictly than are old\ntechnologies and familiar risks. 11 Man-made carcinogens are carefully scrutinized,\nwhile much higher levels of natural carcinogens may be tolerated. Because of this\nimbalance, we pay more dollars for our products and end up with greater risks to our\nlives.\nStudies of consumers show that many individuals would be willing to pay a\npremium for the assured elimination of a risk. 12 The Russian roulette problem\nillustrates. Consider two alternative scenarios for a forced round of play. In the first,\nyou have the option to purchase and remove one bullet from a gun that has three\nbullets in its six chambers. How much would you pay for this reduction in risk?\n(Assume you are unmarried, with no children.) In the second situation, the gun has\nonly a single bullet. How much would you pay to buy back this bullet? From an\neconomic standpoint, you should always be willing to pay at least as much and\ntypically more in the first situation since there is some chance you will be killed by\none of the remaining bullets, in which case money is worthless (or worth less). 13\nHowever, experiments find respondents are typically willing to pay more when a\nsingle bullet is in the gun, because its removal will ensure survival. 14\nThe Chilean grape scare provides a recent example of a risk that does not lend\nitself to statistical estimation or scientific assessment. Neither the government nor\nconsumers could estimate how much consumers' risk was increased by the discov-\nery of traces of cyanide in two Chilean grapes in Philadelphia. 15 When precise\nscientific judgments concerning probabilities are elusive, regret is likely to play a\nsignificant role. 16 If societal norms were flouted, regret would be greater still. (Few\nof us would leave a baby sleeping alone in a house while we drove off on a ten-\nminute errand, even though car-crash risks are much greater than home risks.)\nHindsight is frequently able to identify why an individual or society should have\nknown certain risk estimates were far too low, as we "learned" from the highway\n\n152\nRisk Regulation\nRi\ncollapse during the San Francisco earthquake. Regret is less of an issue when\nconsequences cannot be tied back to a particular risk exposure or a particular\ndecision maker.\nThe valuation of a risk is likely to depend on how the risk is generated. We\ntolerate voluntarily assumed risks more than those, such as environmental hazards,\nover which we have no control. We regard acts of commission as much more serious\nthan acts of omission. In pharmaceutical screening, for example, the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) worries more about introducing harmful new drugs than\nabout missing opportunities for risk reduction offered by new pharmaceutical prod-\nucts.17\nAgency Dilemmas\nProblems of risk perception and valuation may become entangled with so-called\nagency problems. What rules apply when one individual or organization (the agent)\nmakes risk decisions on behalf of another (the principal)? Should the agent replicate\nshortcomings in the principal's decision-making capabilities? Suppose there is one\nchance in 10,000 that a drug will have adverse consequences as severe as those of\nthalidomide. If the drug offers significant health benefits, it may be best for society\nto permit this risk-particularly since approving the drug would generate informa-\ntion useful in risk assessment, and the decision could be reversed if appropriate. Yet\nin practice, the FDA (society's agent) would probably not make such a decision,\nbecause of its bias toward avoiding new risks.18\nSociety's pattern of lopsided tradeoffs between errors of omission and commis-\nsion persists for at least two reasons. First, apart from people's levels of risk, their\nconsumption of information is relevant. When a federal agency demonstrates that it\nwill not take chances with individual health, that reassurance alone enhances indi-\nvidual welfare. Conversely, a perception that the government tolerates risks to the\npublic might be more damaging than the risks themselves. Second, it is easier to\nobserve the costs of bad drugs that are approved than to assess the foregone benefits\nof good drugs that were not introduced. (Note, however, that potential beneficiaries,\nsuch as the users of saccharin and AIDS victims, sometimes put substantial pressure\non the FDA to compromise normally stringent procedures for approving food addi-\ntives and drugs.)19\nHow should we proceed once we admit that individuals do not react to many risks\n"correctly"? We might ask the government to make many more decisions. It is not\nclear, however, that the government itself is well equipped to compute certain risks\naccurately or to make sensible decisions once that information is obtained. Alter-\nnatively, we could shift decision-making authority to those best qualified to make\nparticular kinds of choices. Here, however, the problem arises that the preferences\nof those making a decision might not be the same as those affected by it. A third\npossibility would be to develop processes enabling both agents and principals to\nparticipate in risk-related decisions, but there is little evidence that such processes\nwould produce convergence. Finally, we might try to improve individuals' decision\nmaking skills by providing them, for example, with expert-certified information,\nmuch as accounting firms verify the accuracy of reported financial data.\nTI\nSc\nci\nfro\nth\nth\nth\n4:\nda\naş\npe\nat\nb\nn\nto\nti\nd\nc\na\np\nC\nn\n上\nF\nt\n(\nt\n(\n:\n\ngulation\nRisk within Reason\n153\n> when\nrticular\ned.

With respect to\ncigarette smoking, for example, this may not be the same thing as seeking a smoke-\nfree society. (Note that research linking aflatoxin and cancer risks20 has not moved\nthe Surgeon General to call for a peanut butter-free society.) Politically, of course,\nthe passive smoking concern may be a trump card, rendering it irrelevant whether\nthe risk imposed on others is substantial or negligible.\nHazard warnings are often used to convey risk information. Congress has man-\ndated labels for cigarettes, artificial sweeteners, and alcoholic beverages. Federal\nagencies impose labeling requirements for consumer products, workplace risks, and\npesticides. Informational efforts work in conjunction with market forces rather than\nattempting to supersede them.\nIndividuals may have difficulty processing risk information, however. 21 Overam-\nbitious information efforts may outstrip decision-making capabilities (e.g., Califor-\nnia Proposition 65,22 which requires warnings for products that expose consumers\nto annual risks of cancer of 1 in 7 million). The dangers are underreaction, overreac-\ntion, and nonreaction-a complete dismissal of the risk information effort. Sound\ndecisions are unlikely to result. Indeed, the supposition of informed consent is\ncalled into question.\nMore general human cognitive limitations also work against detailed information-\nal efforts. If a warning label contains more than a handful of items, or if warnings\nproliferate, problems of information overload arise: 23\nIn a democratic society, one should hesitate to override the legitimate preferences\nof segments of the population, taking care not to dismiss diversity of taste as mere\nnonrational choice. Where there is broad consensus on a rational course of action,\nhowever, and either the cost of providing information is high or individuals cannot\nprocess the information adequately, then mandatory requirements may be preferable\nto risk information efforts. Laws requiring the use of seat belts are one possible\nexample.\nIndividuals often fail to interpret risks or value their consequences accurately.\nGovernment efforts may escape some of these biases but are often thrown off course\nby political pressures and agency losses. The consequence is that our risk portfolio\nenjoys no legitimacy and satisfies no one. The first step toward a remedy is to\ndevelop a broad-based understanding of the nature of risk.\n9.3 REASON AND INFORMATION ABOUT RISK\nInformation on risk is generated through several mechanisms. The most salient\nsource is scientific research, but information can also be gained through experience,\nand knowledge of such information can be increased by distributing it more widely.\nRisk, Uncertainty, and Ignorance\nIt is helpful to distinguish among risk, uncertainty, and ignorance. In the situation of\nrisk, we know the states of the world that may prevail (a flipped coin will show one\n\n156\nRisk Regulation\nMaking the Most of Uncertainty\nInformation is valuable when it accurately represents the risks posed. For one-time-\nonly decisions, from the standpoint of Bayesian decision making, the mean assess-\nment of the probability of each outcome is all that matters, for that gives the\nlikelihood with which the outcome will be received. For example, with option I\nthere is a 10 percent chance that a 0.01 risk is imposed and a 90 percent chance that\nno risk is imposed. With option II, there is a 100 percent chance of a 0.002 risk.\nOption I should be preferred since its mean risk, 0.1 × 0.01 + 0.9 × 0 = 0.001, is\nlower than for option II.28\nIn situations of learning and sequential decisions, the precision of the estimate\nalso matters. Paradoxically, imprecisely known probabilities are more favorable, as\nsome simple examples illustrate. Suppose you must choose between two alternative\nmedical treatments. Choice A is known to cure half the patients to whom it is\napplied. Choice B is an experimental treatment that is equally likely to be either\nperfect or worthless. In each case, the probability of a cure is 0.5. On a one-time-\nout basis the two options are equally attractive.\nWith two patients in sequential trials, however, the correct strategy is to pursue\nB. If the first patient recovers, give the second the same treatment; otherwise switch\nto A. With this strategy, on average one and one-fourth of two patients will recover,\nas opposed to only one out of two if the better-known treatment A is chosen at the\noutset. (This is equivalent to the simplest version of the classic two-armed bandit\nproblem.)29 In any choice between a certain and an uncertain risk of an adverse\noutcome, if the initial mean value for the probability is the same, the uncertain risk\nis preferable when learning and adaptive behavior after experience are possible.\nNow suppose the experimental treatment is treatment C, which will turn out to be\neither a total failure or a 90 percent cure (with both possibilities equally likely).\nTrying C rather than A will be preferable (offering an expected 1.13 cures), 30 but\nnow the first patient will face unfavorable odds with experimental treatment C (0.45\nrather than 0.5 with A). If randomization is not possible, or if the first patient\nobjects, perhaps even after a lottery is conducted, ethical norms would require\noffering the patient treatment A. This argument has been illogically extended to\nsuggest that even if experimental treatment C looks better than established treatment\nA. we may find out it was worse, and we should therefore stick with A. In the\nmedical context, patient interest provides an antidote to such misconceptions. Many\nexperimental technologies are not blessed with such a counterweight.\nRegulatory Efforts and Misplaced Conservatism\nGovernment efforts at developing risk information are not guided by the formal\nstatistical properties of the risk but rather by administrative procedures incorporat-\ning various types of "conservatism." Although risk-assessment biases may operate\nin both directions, 31 most approved procedures tend to overstate the actual risk. 32 In\nregulating toxic substances, for example, results from the most sensitive animal\nspecies are often used, and government agencies such as the EPA routinely focus on\nthe upper end of the 95 percent confidence interval as the risk level rather than use\nthe mean of the distribution. A series of such conservative assumptions (e.g., on\n\nRisk within Reason\n157\nexposure or focusing on the most sensitive humans) can overstate the mean proba-\nbility of an unfavorable outcome by several orders of magnitude.\nIf lives are at stake, should we not be conservative when risk estimates are known\nto be uncertain? In fact, conservatism of this nature is undesirable for three reasons.\nFirst, these conservative biases often are not uniform across risks, so that compara-\ntive risk judgments may be in error. If we focus on reducing risks for which standard\nerrors are large with respect to their level, then we will save fewer expected lives\nthan if we were guided by the mean of our probability distribution on the risk level.\nIn effect, society will be curtailing the wrong risks, ones that offer less expected\nhealth improvement than other available options, for the resources and benefits\nforegone. The bias that results will cut against new technologies and innovative\nproducts. Second, stringent regulation of uncertain risks destroys opportunities for\nlearning, ignoring the lesson of the medical treatment example above. Third and\nmost fundamental, tilting risk assessments in a conservative direction confuses the\ninformational and decision aspects of research about risks. A conceptually sound\nform of conservatism would have the decision maker (not the risk estimator) adjust\nthe weights on the consequences. Adjusting the probabilities amounts to lying to\nourselves about what we expect.\n9.4 TOWARD REASONABLE POLICIES TOWARD RISK\nRestrictions on a risky activity, such as exposure limits or restrictions in use, should\nbe based on the relative gains and losses of the activity as compared with its\nalternatives. In thinking about these tradeoffs, one should remember that improve-\nments in mortality and morbidity have come primarily from technological progress\nand a higher standard of living, not from government regulation or private for-\nbearance. 33 A dramatic case in point is that of postwar Japan, where mortality rates\nhave fallen for all age groups. Over the period 1955-1975, with a rapid rise in the\nstandard of living, mortality rates for men aged 65-69 fell 32 percent; men aged\n25-29 had a 64 percent drop. 34 Sustained economic development also seems to be\nthe principal factor in explaining mortality gains in the United States. In contrast,\nrisk-regulation policies often provide few major dividends. 35\nIt is useful to think about risk-averting policy in terms of the rates of tradeoff\ninvolved, such as the cost per expected life saved. Using this lives-saved standard of\nvalue highlights the most effective means of promoting our risk reduction objec-\ntive. 36 The cost-effectiveness of existing regulations ranges widely, from $200,000\nper life saved for airplane cabin fire protection to as much as $132 million per life\nsaved for a 1979 regulation of DES in cattle feed. 37 These wide discrepancies reflect\ndifferences among agencies in their risk-cost balancing as well as differences in the\ncharacter of risk-reducing opportunities. The Federal Aviation Administration has\ntraditionally undervalued lives, looking only at lost earnings, whereas food additive\nregulations and EPA ambient air quality standards are set without consideration of\ncost. Elimination of such interagency imbalances would foster better control of risks\nat less cost.\nThe fundamental policy question is how far to proceed with lifesaving expendi-	2025-01-08 01:22:24.612818	2025-01-08 01:22:24.61282	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Viscusi - Fatal Tradeoffs - pp 149-160-3996", "chunks_count": 8}

He works in other strata of the psyche and has little to do\nwith the emotional impulses that provide the usual subject matter\nof aesthetics, impulses that are restrained, inhibited in their aims\nand dependent on numerous attendant circumstances. Yet now and\nthen it happens that he has to take an interest in a particular area of\naesthetics, and then it is usually a marginal one that has been\nneglected in the specialist literature.\nOne such is the 'uncanny'. There is no doubt that this belongs to\nthe realm of the frightening, of what evokes fear and dread. It is\nequally beyond doubt that the word is not always used in a clearly\ndefinable sense, and so it commonly merges with what arouses\nfear in general. Yet one may presume that there exists a specific\naffective nucleus, which justifies the use of a special conceptual\nterm. One would like to know the nature of this common nucleus,\nwhich allows us to distinguish the 'uncanny' within the field of the\nfrightening.\nOn this topic we find virtually nothing in the detailed accounts of\naesthetics, which on the whole prefer to concern themselves with\nour feelings for the beautiful, the grandiose and the attractive – that\nis to say, with feelings of a positive kind, their determinants and the\nobjects that arouse them - rather than with their opposites, feelings\nof repulsion and distress. In the medico-psychological literature I\nknow only one study on the subject, that of E. Jentsch;¹ and this,\nwhile rich in content, is not exhaustive. True, I have to own that, for\n123\n\nThe Uncanny\nreasons that are not hard to divine, and inherent in the times we\nlive in, I have not undertaken a thorough survey of the literature,\nespecially the foreign literature, that would be relevant to the present\nmodest contribution, which is therefore presented to the reader\nwith no claim to priority.\nJentsch stresses, as one of the difficulties attendant upon the\nstudy of the uncanny, the fact that people differ greatly in their\nsensitivity to this kind of feeling. Indeed, the present writer must\nplead guilty to exceptional obtuseness in this regard, when great\ndelicacy of feeling would be more appropriate. It is a long time since\nhe experienced or became acquainted with anything that conveyed\nthe impression of the uncanny. He must first put himself in the\nproper state of feeling and so put himself in the way of experiencing\na sense of the uncanny. Yet such difficulties play an important part\nin other areas of aesthetics too; hence one need not, for that reason,\ngive up hope of finding cases in which the feeling in question will\nbe unequivocally acknowledged by most people.\nThere are thus two courses open to us: either we can investigate\nthe semantic content that has accrued to the German word unheim-\nlich [of which the nearest semantic equivalents in English are\n'uncanny' and 'eerie', but which etymologically corresponds to\n'unhomely'] as the language has developed, or we can assemble\nwhatever it is about persons and things, sense impressions, experi-\nences and situations, that evokes in us a sense of the uncanny, and\nthen go on to infer its hidden nature from what all these have in\ncommon. I can say in advance that both these courses lead to the\nsame conclusion – that the uncanny is that species of the frightening\nthat goes back to what was once well known and had long been\nfamiliar. How this can be – under what conditions the familiar can\nbecome uncanny and frightening - will emerge in what follows. I\nmust add that the present study actually began with a collection of\nindividual cases and that the findings were only later corroborated\nby what we are told by [German] linguistic usage, but here I shall\nwork in reverse order.\nUnheimlich is clearly the opposite of heimlich, heimisch, ver-\ntraut, and it seems obvious that something should be frightening\n124\n:\nI The Uncanny\nprecisely because it is unknown and unfamiliar. But of course the\nconverse is not true: not everything new and unfamiliar is frighten-\ning. All one can say is that what is novel may well prove frightening\nand uncanny; some things that are novel are indeed frightening, but\nby no means all. Something must be added to the novel and the\nunfamiliar if it is to become uncanny.\nOn the whole Jentsch does not go beyond relating the uncanny\nto the novel and the unfamiliar. For him the essential condition for\nthe emergence of a sense of the uncanny is intellectual uncertainty.\nOne would suppose, then, that the uncanny would always be an area\nin which a person was unsure of his way around: the better oriented\nhe was in the world around him, the less likely he would be to find\nthe objects and occurrences in it uncanny.\nThis definition is clearly not exhaustive. We will therefore try to\ngo beyond a mere equation of the uncanny with the unfamiliar and\nturn first to other languages. But the dictionaries we consult tell us\nnothing new, if only perhaps because we ourselves speak a foreign\nlanguage. Indeed, we gain the impression that many languages lack\na word for this particular species of the frightening.3\nLATIN (K. E. Georges, Kleines Deutsch-Lateinisches Wörter-\nbuch 1898): 'ein unheimlicher Ort' ['an eerie place'] – locus sus-\npectus; 'in unheimlicher Nachtzeit' ['in the eerie night hours']\nintempesta nocte.\nGREEK (from the dictionaries of Rost and Schenkl): xénos,\n'foreign, alien'.\nENGLISH (from the dictionaries of Lucas, Bellows, Flügel and\nMuret-Sanders): uncomfortable, uneasy, gloomy, dismal, uncanny,\nghastly, (of a house): haunted, (of a person): a repulsive fellow.\naise.\nFRENCH (Sachs-Villatte): inquiétant, sinistre, lugubre, mal à son\nSPANISH (Tollhausen 1889): sospechoso, de mal aguero, lúgubre,\nsiniestro.\nItalian and Portuguese seem to make do with words that we\nwould call periphrases. In Arabic and Hebrew the 'uncanny' merges\nwith the 'demonic' and the gruesome'.\nSo let us return to German. In Daniel Sanders' Wörterbuch der\n125\n\nThe Uncanny\nDeutschen Sprache of 1860 we find the following information on\nthe word heimlich, which I reproduce here in full, drawing attention\nto certain passages (vol. I, p. 729):4\nHeimlich. adj.

As witness the passage from Gutzkow: 'We call that\nunheimlich; you call it heimlich. This reminds us that this word\nheimlich is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which\nare not mutually contradictory, but very different from each other -\nthe one relating to what is familiar and comfortable, the other to\nwhat is concealed and kept hidden. Unheimlich is the antonym of\nheimlich only in the latter's first sense, not in its second. Sanders\nsuggests no genetic connection between the two senses. On the\nother hand, our attention is seized by Schelling's remark, which says\nsomething quite new - something we certainly did not expect -\nabout the meaning of unheimlich, namely, that the term 'uncanny'\n(unheimlich) applies to everything that was intended to remain\nsecret, hidden away, and has come into the open.\nSome of the doubts that arise here are cleared up by the data in\nthe German Dictionary of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (Deutsches\nWörterbuch, Leipzig 1877, IV/2, 873ff.):\n132\nI The Uncanny\nHeimlich: adj. and adv. vernaculus, occultus: Middle High German\nheimelîch, heimlich.\np. 874: In a somewhat different sense: es ist mir heimlich, 'I feel\nwell, free from fear', [3] b) heimlich is also used of a place that is\nfree of ghostly influences...\np. 875: B) familiar; friendly, confiding.\n4. Starting from the homely and the domestic, there is a\nfurther development towards the notion of something\nremoved from the eyes of strangers, hidden, secret. This\nnotion is extended in a number of ways...\np. 876:\nlinks am see\nliegt eine matte heimlich im gehölz\nSchiller, Wilhelm Tell I, 4\n(To the left by the lake\nlies a meadow hidden among the trees.)\nUncommon in modern usage is the combination of heimlich with\na verb denoting concealment: Er verbirgt mich heimlich in seinem\ngezelt (Psalm 27, 5), [AV: 'In the secret of his tabernacle shall he\nhide me']. Secret places on the human body, the pudenda: welche\nLeute nicht sturben, die wurden geschlagen an heimlichen örten,\nI Samuel 5, 12: "Those who did not die were smitten in secret places',\n[AV: 'And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods'].\nc) Officials who dispense important advice on affairs of state that\nis to be kept secret are called heimliche räthe ('privy councillors');\nin modern usage the adjective is replaced by geheim (q.v.): Pharao\nnennet ihn (Joseph) den heimlichen rath, 'Pharaoh named him the\nprivy councillor', Gen. 41, 45;\np. 878: 6. heimlich as used of knowledge, mystical, allegorical:\nheimliche bedeutung ('secret meaning'), mysticus, divinus, occultus,\nfiguratus.\np. 878: in the following heimlich is used differently for what is\nwithdrawn from knowledge, unconscious...\nbut then heimlich also means 'locked away, inscrutable':...\n133\n\nThe Uncanny\nmerkst du wohl? sie trauen uns nicht,\nfürchten des Friedländers heimlich gesicht.\nSchiller, Wallensteins Lager, scene 2\n(Do you see? They do not trust us,\nthey fear the inscrutable face of the\nFriedländer [i.e. Wallenstein].)\n9. The notion of the hidden and the dangerous, which\nappears in the last section, undergoes a further development,\nso that heimlich acquires the sense that otherwise belongs to\nunheimlich (formed from heimlich, 3 b, col. 874: mir ist zu zeiten\nwie dem menschen der in nacht wandelt und an gespenster glaubt,\njeder winkel ist ihm heimlich und schauerhaft, 'I sometimes feel like\na sleepwalker who believes in ghosts: every corner seems to him\neerie and frightening'), Klinger, Theater, 3, 298.\nHeimlich thus becomes increasingly ambivalent, until it finally\nmerges with its antonym unheimlich. The uncanny (das Unheim-\nliche, 'the unhomely') is in some way a species of the familiar (das\nHeimliche, 'the homely'). Let us relate this finding, which still has\nto be explained, to Schelling's definition of the uncanny. Separate\ninvestigations of cases of the uncanny will enable us to make sense\nof these hints.\n134\nII\nIf we now go on to review the persons and things, the impressions,\nprocesses and situations that can arouse an especially strong and\ndistinct sense of the uncanny in us, we must clearly choose an\nappropriate example to start with. E. Jentsch singles out, as an\nexcellent case, 'doubt as to whether an apparently animate object\nreally is alive and, conversely, whether a lifeless object might not\nperhaps be animate'. In this connection he refers to the impressions\nmade on us by waxwork figures, ingeniously constructed dolls and\nautomata. To these he adds the uncanny effect produced by epileptic\nfits and the manifestations of insanity, because these arouse in the\nonlooker vague notions of automatic – mechanical - processes that\nmay lie hidden behind the familiar image of a living person. Now,\nwhile not wholly convinced by the author's arguments, we will take\nthem as a starting point for our own investigation, because he goes\non to remind us of one writer who was more successful than any\nother at creating uncanny effects.\n'One of the surest devices for producing slightly uncanny effects\nthrough story-telling,' writes Jentsch, 'is to leave the reader wonder-\ning whether a particular figure is a real person or an automaton, and\nto do so in such a way that his attention is not focused directly on\nthe uncertainty, lest he should be prompted to examine and settle\nthe matter at once, for in this way, as we have said, the special\nemotional effect can easily be dissipated. E. T. A. Hoffmann often\nemployed this psychological manoeuvre with success in his imaginat-\nive writings.'\nThis observation, which is undoubtedly correct, refers in particu-\nlar to Hoffmann's story "The Sand-Man', one of the 'Night Pieces'\n135	2025-01-09 20:29:31.866278	2025-01-09 20:29:31.86628	ready	{"topic_key": "pdf-Freud - The Uncanny-4913", "chunks_count": 8}

087c8c19-2ffd-4a88-96e0-b12175a4018a	\N	assistant	Based on the excerpt, Gandalf stands out as a particularly compelling character. His unwavering defiance against the Lord of the Nazgûl, despite the overwhelming threat, embodies the themes of hope and courage in the face of despair. Gandalf's presence symbolizes the resilience of good in the struggle against evil, as he commands the Nazgûl to retreat and holds his ground at the gate. This act of defiance highlights his role as a steadfast protector, a pivotal element in the narrative's tension and thematic depth. However, remember that as an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I can analyze the significance of characters in context.	2024-12-15 20:22:12.232555	null	0

SUMMARY OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES\n\n1. The very Self of all creatures is Mahesvara, one, whose form is all, full of the undivided consciousness “this”. The one, full of the ‘savouring’ (camatkara) of the undivided perceiving subject, of the undivided perceptible object and of the fusion of the two, in the fourth state which is to be sought first, the Self common to all living beings, whose form is all, is Mahesvara. — 1 —\n\n2. There (tatra), realities such as the mind etc., which are included in the sphere of the ‘this’ freely created [by the Lord] (svasrstedambhage), are caused by him to be considered as the fictitious I (ahamkara) as being the perceiving subject. This universe springing forth as constituted by the free expansion (jrmbha) of the supreme Lord, realities that are created as the object\n\n1 The translation refers to the most immediate and general meaning of the text of the kârikâ. The far more complex explanation given by the vrtti depends on considering the two terms of the expression aham idam first separately and then together. 2 The above note has already mentioned how this interpretation has been arrived at. As Abh. explains (see text note 2), we have here the reflective awareness of the perceiving subject as not distinct from the other subjects, i.e. of the fundamental unity of the subject beneath the apparent fragmentation; the same applies to the object; and finally the awareness of the ultimate non-otherness (melana) of subject and object. 3 Because starting from this the maculation begins to dissolve (see text note 1). 4 The text, which remains doubtful, seems to contain a double interpretation (tantra) of tatra in the kârikâ (which I have translated in a deliberately vague manner): mahesvarasya jrmblmmaye ’smin nirgate and tasminn idantâparâmarse. This would coincide with the brief references in IPVV III p. 358 to the fikâ, which evidently gave this type of interpretation: tatra iti vaiyadhikaranyena vivrtya sâmâ- nâdhikaranyena vivrnoti (i.e. tatra taken alone or agreeing with °blwge). Abh. in his two commentaries also follows the line of the simultaneous double function of tatra, which he refers in both cases to Mahesvara: ‘Mahesvara being the self, the part ‘this’ is created by him upon a substratum constituted by himself’ (thus in the first case\n\n210\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nfull of the undivided consciousness “this”.\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

52d2d627-69d8-4f9c-b3e8-03c77bc6b2f5	\N	assistant	This excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" demonstrates a classic high fantasy confrontation. It uses rich symbolism and thematic elements to convey the tension and stakes in the struggle between good and evil.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Dramatic Confrontation:** Gandalf's encounter with the Lord of the Nazgûl is depicted as a pivotal moment. Gandalf's steadfast defiance and his role as a symbol of hope are central to the narrative, contrasting with the menacing aura of the Nazgûl.\n\n2. **Symbolic Imagery:** The Nazgûl's crown without a visible head underscores the otherworldly, fearsome nature of the enemy. Meanwhile, the crowing of the cock serves as an unexpected intervention that shifts the scene from despair to hope.\n\n3. **The Turning of the Tide:** The arrival of the Rohan army, signaled by the horns, represents a major shift in the dynamic of the battle. This moment emphasizes the theme of hope, reinforced by seemingly minor occurrences, such as the crowing of the cock, which heralds a new beginning as dawn breaks.\n\n4. **Themes of Good vs. Evil:** This scene distills the quintessential battle between these opposing forces. Gandalf embodies resilience and hope in the face of darkness, working within the larger narrative's ongoing struggle.\n\nOverall, the excerpt is vivid in its portrayal of climactic tension, using both grand and minute elements to weave a scene full of dramatic and thematic power.	2024-12-15 19:56:30.329362	null	0

d6349367-d348-46d1-8933-c34566eaec2b	\N	assistant	The highlighted themes in this excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" include:\n\n1. **Good vs. Evil:** There is a clear depiction of this classic battle, with Gandalf representing the force of good as he stands firm against the malevolent Lord of the Nazgûl. This theme is central to the story, emphasizing the age-old struggle between light and darkness.\n\n2. **Hope vs. Despair:** The scene contrasts the menacing presence of the Nazgûl with symbols of hope, such as the unexpected crowing of a cock and the sound of Rohan's horns. These small but significant events suggest that even in the darkest times, there is a glimmer of hope.\n\n3. **Unexpected Intervention:** The crowing of the cock might seem insignificant, but it disrupts the Nazgûl's power, illustrating how minor occurrences can have significant consequences. This highlights that not all changes in fortune are driven by monumental acts—sometimes, small events can shift the tide.\n\n4. **Symbolism:** The passage is rich with symbolic imagery and sounds—such as shadow, fire, and the abyss—that contribute to the scene's dramatic tension and depth. The cock's crow and horns symbolize the dawn of a new hope and the approach of change or salvation.\n\nThese themes intertwine to enhance the narrative with layers of meaning and maintain the reader's engagement by juxtaposing despair with the promise of hope.	2024-12-20 03:26:05.685626	null	0

5246cf71-84bd-44f4-9fae-8481ca3c1a54	\N	assistant	This excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is rich with classic themes and literary techniques that drive its dramatic impact.\n\n1. **Good vs. Evil**: This confrontation embodies the quintessential struggle between good and evil. Gandalf, as the epitome of determination and virtue, faces the Lord of the Nazgûl, who exudes darkness and malevolence. The vivid descriptions emphasize the stark contrast between these forces, highlighting the bravery required to stand against overwhelming evil.\n\n2. **Hope vs. Despair**: The excerpt deftly balances elements of hope and despair through two pivotal moments: Gandalf's unyielding stance and the cock's crow. The crowing, a seemingly mundane occurrence, brings a breath of optimism, cutting through the tension and despair wrought by the Nazgûl's presence. This symbolism aligns with the unexpected turning points that often shift the tides of fortune in Tolkien’s work.\n\n3. **Unexpected Intervention**: The arrival of the Rohan army, foreshadowed by natural events like the cock’s crow, underscores the theme of unexpected aid. Tolkien frequently uses nature and chance occurrences as catalysts for change, positioning them as instruments of fate that favor the protagonists, illustrating the narrative's intricate layering of destiny and free will.\n\n4. **Symbolism**: Symbolic imagery is central to this passage. The shadow and flame associated with the Nazgûl contrast with the bright hope signified by dawn and the horns of Rohan, reinforcing the dualistic nature of light conquering darkness. These symbols not only build tension but also enrich the thematic exploration of the story.\n\nOverall, the passage expertly weaves together these elements to create a moment of high drama that is pivotal to the narrative’s progression, reflecting Tolkien's mastery in blending suspense with deeper thematic meaning.	2024-12-15 19:56:39.562636	null	0

It provides a structured way to think about the processes of writing and reading, highlighting the dynamics of meaning-making:\n\n1. **Projection in Writing:** By framing writing as a projection, the model suggests that authors transform their multi-layered thoughts, emotions, and concepts into the more constrained form of a written text. This mirrors how a projection mathematically reduces dimensions, simplifying and compressing complex realities into a form that can be shared and interpreted.\n\n2. **Unprojection in Reading:** Conversely, reading as an unprojection process emphasizes the active role of the reader in constructing meaning. Readers are seen as reconstructing the broader, more nuanced ideas initially projected by the author, deciphering layers of intentions, symbols, and contextual nuances. This interaction reflects the interpretive and often subjective nature of engaging with a text.\n\n3. **Interpreting Ambiguity and Complexity:** This framework is particularly apt for complex texts like Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, which challenge readers with layers of ambiguity and unreliable narration. It underscores the idea that a text isn't a fixed entity but one that lives and breathes through the interactive process of reading and interpretation.\n\n4. **Limitations and Extensions:** While this model is insightful, it may not capture all the dynamics of textual interaction—especially with texts that don't conform neatly to projective-unprojective dynamics, such as those prioritizing form over content. Moreover, it asks us to consider how much of the "original" meaning is recoverable, an exploration that reveals much about both the author and the reader.\n\nOverall, viewing texts through this lens encourages a deeper engagement with their structural and philosophical complexities. It's a reminder of the active, dialogic nature of reading, where both author and reader bring subjectivity into creating meaning. If you'd like to explore examples or further implications of this model, feel free to ask!	2024-12-15 20:24:08.469721	null	0

Writing involves not just compression of thoughts but an artistic shaping that includes style, tone, and form. This framework might not fully capture those qualitative elements.\n\n2. **Subjective Reconstruction:** The idea of unprojection places heavy emphasis on the reader's ability to reconstruct the author's original intent. Given the subjectivity involved in reading, interpretations may vary widely. This variance can complicate the assumption that the original "projected" meaning can be universally accessed or understood.\n\n3. **Complex Texts:** While the framework is useful for structurally complex works like *Pale Fire*, it might not be as effective for texts that don’t rely heavily on layers or hidden meanings, where a straightforward message or narrative is intended.\n\n4. **Interactivity Limitation:** This model may overlook the interactive element of interpretation, where meaning arises not just from reconstruction but also from the reader's own contextual influences, prior experiences, and imaginative leaps.\n\n5. **The Stability of the 'Shared Code':** The framework assumes a shared code between author and reader that enables this projection/unprojection. However, cultural, temporal, or linguistic differences can destabilize this code, leading to misinterpretations or divergent readings.\n\n6. **Intentional Fallacy:** The model could inadvertently lend itself to an overemphasis on authorial intent, potentially marginalizing textual elements that encourage multiple readings or interpretations independent of intent.\n\nDespite these challenges, the framework encourages a dynamic view of reading and writing, highlighting the complex dance of encoding and decoding meaning. It invites readers to think about the active role they play in bringing a text to life, which is a valuable literary insight. If you're interested, we could explore specific examples where this framework might be applied or falter.	2024-12-15 20:24:17.183378	null	0

This approach highlights the multifaceted nature of these concepts by drawing parallels between mathematical, psychological, and literary interpretations. \n\nKey insights include:\n\n1. **Projection and Unprojection Framework:** The text references both Freudian psychology and mathematical projection, establishing a basis for understanding how literature functions similarly. Writing is seen as a form of projection, condensing complex ideas and emotions, while reading entails unprojection, or the reconstruction of those ideas from textual cues.\n\n2. **Nabokov's Innovation:** The chunk emphasizes Nabokov's novel approach in *Pale Fire*—rather than just translating narrative facets to higher dimensions, the text examines the roles of the interpretive functions themselves. This creates an "interplay of shadows and reflections" between the poem and Kinbote's commentary, enriching the narrative.\n\n3. **Gradus’s Contradictory Nature:** Gradus is presented as a character who embodies the novel’s themes. Although Kinbote mocks him, the analysis suggests that his role is multifaceted, inviting a deeper exploration of how Gradus functions within this projection framework.\n\nOverall, the section skillfully weaves together literary theory with mathematical and psychological concepts, setting the stage for a deeper examination of Gradus’s role in the narrative.

This approach is effective in illustrating how Nabokov plays with narrative structures and interpretations:\n\n1. **Projection as Condensation:** Viewing writing as a form of projection that condenses complex ideas aligns well with Nabokov's intricate storytelling, where layers of meaning and narrative are condensed into seemingly simple forms.\n\n2. **Unprojection and Interpretation:** The idea of reading as unprojection, where readers reconstruct the original complexity from the text, resonates with the experience of engaging with Nabokov's work. His texts often require readers to piece together meaning from clues, akin to solving a puzzle.\n\n3. **Interplay between Shade and Kinbote:** The dual structure of the poem and Kinbote's commentary perfectly encapsulates the interplay of projection and unprojection. Kinbote's interpretations and extensions serve to transform the poem into a broader narrative landscape, which the framework aptly captures.\n\nWhile the framework is compelling, it's important to consider that such theoretical models are interpretations themselves. They provide one way to understand the text but may not encompass all of its nuances. This model encourages deeper engagement with Nabokov's storytelling techniques but should be seen as part of a broader conversation about the novel's meaning and structure. If you'd like, we can explore how this framework might illuminate other aspects of *Pale Fire* or how it compares to other interpretations.	2024-12-15 20:23:52.416878	null	0

05e253b8-e2fe-493c-964c-cd1208ceea4d	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\n## Lord of the Rings: Return of the King - Excerpt Analysis\n\nThis excerpt depicts a dramatic confrontation between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl at the gates of Minas Tirith.\n\n**The Arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Lord of the Nazgûl, a towering, menacing figure, arrives, riding under an archway never before breached by an enemy.  All flee except Gandalf, who sits steadfastly on Shadowfax before the Gate.\n\n**Gandalf's Defiance:**\n\nGandalf confronts the Lord of the Nazgûl, forbidding his entry:  "You cannot enter here," he commands, halting the approaching shadow.  He then forcefully urges the Nazgûl to return to the abyss prepared for him.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Black Rider throws back his hood, revealing a kingly crown, though no head is visible beneath it. A deadly laughter emanates from the unseen mouth.  The Nazgûl taunts Gandalf, boasting of his victory and challenging him to death. He raises his flaming sword.\n\n**The Unexpected Turning Point:**\n\nAt this crucial moment, a cock crows in a nearby courtyard, a simple, unassuming sound that heralds the approaching dawn. This seemingly insignificant event marks a turning of the tide.\n\n**Rohan's Arrival:**\n\nFollowing the cock's crow, distant horns sound from the slopes of Mount Mindolluin – the arrival of the Rohan army, offering hope and signifying the turning of the tide against the forces of darkness.\n\n\n**Key Elements and Themes:**\n\n* **Good vs. Evil:** The excerpt perfectly illustrates the central conflict of the story, with Gandalf, representing good, standing firm against the overwhelming evil of the Lord of the Nazgûl.\n* **Hope vs. Despair:** The scene balances the immense threat posed by the Nazgûl with the subtle yet powerful symbols of hope: the crowing cock and the sound of Rohan's horns.\n* **Unexpected Intervention:**  The seemingly insignificant act of a cock crowing disrupts the overwhelming power of the Nazgûl and foreshadows the arrival of reinforcements, highlighting the importance of seemingly small events.\n* **Symbolism:**  The use of imagery (shadow, fire, abyss) and sounds (the cock's crow, the horns) is rich in symbolism, contributing to the dramatic tension and thematic depth of the passage.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nrepresenting\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

fc0cb39a-3636-4ea9-884d-2d1e358d2e7b	\N	assistant	The document in question appears to be a structured summary of the Declaration of Independence, providing a clear and detailed examination of its contents while maintaining the original meaning. Below, I will provide an expansive overview of this summary document, section by section:\n\n### I. Preamble: The Right to Separate\n\nThe Declaration opens by asserting the inherent right of people to dissolve political ties with another state, reaffirming their status as equal among nations. This fundamental right is grounded in natural laws and is supported by a need to respectfully communicate the rationale behind their decision for separation. This sets the stage for the document’s purpose—justifying the American colonies' separation from British rule.\n\n### II. Core Principles: Self-Evident Truths\n\nThis section outlines the core philosophical tenets of the Declaration:\n- **Equality**: All men are created equal and possess unalienable rights.\n- **Rights**: These rights include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n- **Government's Role**: Governments exist to secure these rights, deriving power from the consent of the governed.\n- **Right to Revolution**: When a government fails to protect these rights and becomes tyrannical, the people have the right to change or dissolve it. However, such actions are not to be taken lightly, reserved for circumstances where long-standing abuses point towards absolute despotism.\n\n### III. Grievances Against King George III\n\nThis detailed section catalogs the specific grievances the American colonies held against King George III, providing justification for their decision to declare independence. The grievances are organized into categories:\n\n#### A. Legislative Interference\n- The king's refusal to pass laws beneficial to the colonies or requiring oppressive conditions for their enactment.\n- Calling legislative assemblies at inconvenient places or dissolving them altogether.\n\n#### B. Obstruction of Population and Justice\n- Attempts to hinder population growth through manipulation of immigration and land acquisition.\n- Interference with judicial independence, including making judges financially dependent on the king.\n\n#### C. Military Oppression and Subjugation\n- Maintenance of standing armies in peacetime without legislative approval.\n- Obliging the colonies to submit to foreign jurisdiction and laws, such as quartering troops and imposing taxes without consent.\n- Removing the right to trial by jury and other legal rights, which Americans viewed as foundational.\n\n### IV. Conclusion: Declaration of Independence\n\nThe document concludes with the formal declaration that the American colonies are independent from British rule. This section highlights the necessity of declaring independence to protect unalienable rights and to establish a government rooted in liberty and self-governance principles.\n\nThis structured summary not only delineates the content of the original Declaration of Independence but also clarifies the reasoning and philosophical underpinning for the American colonies' decision to seek independence, marking a pivotal moment in history.	2024-12-16 00:23:15.190485	null	0

The analysis uses a mathematical framework involving concepts of projection and unprojection to explore the novel's structure and meaning.

I’ll provide an extended analysis based on the content from the chunk regarding the themes and techniques in Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, specifically concerning projection and unprojection, as well as the character Gradus.\n\nIn the analysis provided, the concept of projection is explored in both a psychological and mathematical sense to dissect the narrative structure of Nabokov's *Pale Fire*. Projection, in the literary context, refers to compressing complex, multidimensional ideas or emotions into a more accessible form, such as the written word. The process of unprojection, then, is the reader's task of interpreting these condensed ideas and reconstructing their full depth, akin to taking a shadow and imagining the object that casts it.\n\nNabokov innovates upon this concept by employing a dual structure in *Pale Fire*, where the primary text, John Shade’s poem, acts as the projection, and Charles Kinbote’s commentary serves as the unprojection attempt. However, unlike traditional interpretations where the reader seeks to decode the author's intent, Nabokov disrupts this connection by interjecting Kinbote's unreliable narration, highlighting the inherent instability in this interpretive process. This novel arrangement transforms *Pale Fire* into a study of how personal biases and subjective realities shape our understanding of texts, emphasizing the discrepancies between Shade's poetic intentions and Kinbote’s interpretations.\n\nGradus, a seemingly minor character manipulated by Kinbote, reflects this theme by embodying contradictions and complexities beyond his portrayal as a mere tool. Kinbote attempts to frame Gradus as a simple, flat character—a shadow without substance. Yet, within the framework of projection and unprojection, Gradus represents the disruptive element that challenges the linear understanding of narrative terms. His character demands deeper scrutiny to unravel the layers of meaning imposed upon him by Kinbote's storytelling, revealing the broader dynamic at play between writer, reader, and the interpretive act.\n\nUltimately, Nabokov’s narrative innovation with Gradus and the dual structure calls attention to the fragility of literary interpretation and the necessity of a shared code between the author and reader. This unique approach not only advances the literary technology of storytelling but also invites readers to reflect on their role in unprojecting the stories they encounter, negotiating meanings often distorted by their own projections.\n\nI hope this expansive analysis aids in understanding the intricate dynamics at play in Nabokov's work.

The presentation you're looking at uses the concepts of projection and unprojection to analyze Nabokov's *Pale Fire*. Let's break down the key ideas:\n\n1. **Projection and Unprojection in Literature**: \n   - **Projection** here refers to the condensing of complex, multidimensional emotions or narratives into simpler, two-dimensional forms like metaphors. This is akin to a mathematical projection where a higher-dimensional space is transformed into a lower-dimensional one.\n   - **Unprojection** involves readers interpreting these metaphors and attempting to reconstruct the original, multifaceted emotions or meanings. It's a bit like trying to imagine the full object from its shadow alone.\n\n2. **Nabokov's Innovation**:\n   - Nabokov was innovative in *Pale Fire* by separating different consciousnesses (Shade's poem vs. Kinbote's commentary), rather than just focusing on unreliable narrators like in earlier literature. This creates a dynamic interplay between the poem and the commentary, reflecting and transforming each other.\n\n3. **Role of Gradus**:\n   - Gradus is a character used to explore these ideas of projection and unprojection. Though Kinbote mocks him and sees him as a mere reflection of his fantastical journey, the analysis suggests that his role is more complex and reveals more about the novel's themes.\n\nThe presentation promises to look at Gradus in more detail, highlighting his contradictions and how he fits into the projection/unprojection framework. If there's a specific aspect of this framework or Gradus's role that you want to explore further, let me know!	2024-12-16 00:22:49.905954	null	0
83c03a73-8795-4fa7-ba30-04f71c0a4aee	\N	assistant	This excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" describes a tense encounter between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl at the gates of Minas Tirith. Here's a breakdown of the key events:\n\n1. **The Arrival:** The Lord of the Nazgûl appears as a threatening and menacing figure, breaking through a gate that no enemy has breached before. His presence causes everyone to flee, except Gandalf, who remains resolute on his trusty horse, Shadowfax.\n\n2. **Gandalf's Defiance:** Despite the imposing threat, Gandalf confronts the Nazgûl with unwavering courage. He forbids the Nazgûl's entry and commands him to return to the abyss, asserting his stand against evil.\n\n3. **The Unveiling:** The Nazgûl dramatically unveils himself, revealing a crown with no head beneath it and emitting a sinister laugh. He taunts Gandalf and raises his flaming sword, intensifying the threat and the confrontation.\n\n4. **The Turning Point:** This tension reaches a climax as a cock crows in a nearby courtyard. Although a simple and ordinary event, this marks a pivotal moment, symbolizing the approaching dawn and foreshadowing a change in fortunes.\n\n5. **Rohan's Arrival:** Following the crow of the cock, the horns of Rohan are heard signaling the arrival of reinforcements. This injects hope into the scene, suggesting the imminent arrival of help and a shift against the forces of darkness.\n\nOverall, the excerpt presents a classic battle between good and evil, underlined by themes of hope and unexpected turns of fate, with symbolic sounds and imagery enhancing the dramatic tension.	2024-12-20 03:26:23.109173	null	0

f96e0dc7-beb8-4fdd-91f6-0108a0bf2113	\N	assistant	Certainly! Let's delve deeply into the dynamics of this excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King," focusing on its narrative, themes, and symbolism.\n\nThe excerpt presents a climactic confrontation between two powerful characters: Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl. The narrative tension is immediate, set against the backdrop of Minas Tirith, an iconic stronghold symbolizing the last bastion against encroaching darkness. The arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl is a pivotal moment, marked by an evocative description of his towering, menacing presence—a physical manifestation of evil, dread, and power. His entrance through an archway previously impervious to enemies underscores the direness of the situation, enhancing the atmosphere of impending doom.\n\nGandalf’s defiance is remarkable not just for its physical presence, standing firm on Shadowfax, but also for the moral and spiritual fortitude he embodies. His declaration, "You cannot enter here," serves both as a physical command and a symbol of resistance against darkness. Gandalf challenges the seemingly inevitable victory of evil with a quiet, unwavering strength—an embodiment of hope and resilience.\n\nThe contrast between the two figures is stark. The Lord of the Nazgûl is cloaked in shadows, a kingly crown atop nothingness, representing ultimate corruption and a void where life should be. This imagery evokes a sense of unease and fills the reader with the menace that the physical description alone might lack. His laughter—described as deadly—conveys a malicious confidence, adding psychological complexity to his challenge against Gandalf.\n\nA crucial turning point in this scene, however, is the crowing of a cock—an everyday sound that juxtaposes the extraordinary and otherworldly conflict unfolding. This simple noise foreshadows the imminent arrival of dawn and reinforces the theme of hope kindling against despair. It serves as an audible symbol that not all is lost and that day, metaphorically and literally, will break darkness’s hold.\n\nThe subsequent sound of the Rohan army's horns amplifies this turning of the tide. Just as darkness threatens to drown Minas Tirith in despair, Rohan's arrival signifies hope and renewal. The horns are not only a relief for the besieged city but also a strategic game-changer that tips the balance of power.\n\nThematically, the passage is rich with the interplay of good versus evil, and hope versus despair. Gandalf’s solitary stand against the Nazgûl’s terrifying advance encapsulates the broader struggle seen throughout the narrative. The cock’s crow and Rohan’s horns symbolize the unexpected aids that can disrupt seemingly insurmountable evil, resonating with the theme that even the smallest acts of courage or seemingly minor natural signs can herald a greater change.\n\nImagery in the passage is powerful, drawing heavily on contrasts between light and darkness, and sound and silence. The descriptions of shadow, fire, and abyss are not only visual metaphors for evil but also amplify the tension and stakes of the conflict. Meanwhile, the sudden introduction of sound—ordinary yet profound—interrupts the malign quiet, contributing symbolic depth that enhances the scene’s dramatic tension and resolution.\n\nOverall, this excerpt not only advances the plot of "Return of the King" but encapsulates many of its core themes and narrative devices, serving as a microcosm of the larger battle between good and evil where hope, often seemingly insignificant, plays a crucial role in overcoming despair.	2024-12-16 00:41:40.811604	\N	0

6f6e7472-266e-4bb6-a5f5-eb6ff46349d1	\N	assistant	Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the concepts related to inflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as described in the document.\n\n### Inflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\n**Inflation** refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. It's an essential economic indicator, as it influences monetary policy, wage negotiations, and investment returns.\n\nThe **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is a crucial tool used by economists and policymakers to measure inflation. In the United States, the CPI is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It is designed to reflect the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a specified basket of goods and services.\n\n#### Key Components and Methodology\n\n1. **Basket of Goods and Services**: \n   - The CPI uses a "basket" of goods and services which includes a wide array of items such as food, energy (like gasoline), housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n   - This basket is not static; it's designed to represent typical urban consumer purchases based on data from the Consumer Expenditures Survey.\n\n2. **Weighting of Items**:\n   - Items in the basket are weighted according to their importance to the average consumer. This means necessary and frequently purchased goods (like groceries) have more influence on the CPI than less commonly purchased items (like luxury goods).\n   - For instance, a change in the price of chicken affects the CPI more than a change in the price of tofu due to higher consumption levels of chicken.\n\n3. **Data Collection**:\n   - The BLS collects prices for these items from around the country using two surveys: one for most goods and services and another focused specifically on housing.\n   - For housing, they estimate what the "owners' equivalent rent" would be, which is the cost to rent a similar property, to account for owner-occupied homes.\n\n4. **Reporting**:\n   - The BLS reports monthly changes in CPI, which can be seasonally adjusted. This helps identify short-term trends and seasonal effects. Additionally, they provide year-over-year comparisons which help gauge long-term inflation trends by comparing the CPI of a given month to that of the same month in the previous year.\n\nUnderstanding the CPI's construction and reporting methods helps one appreciate how complex and comprehensive it is as a tool for measuring inflation. This complexity ensures the CPI can effectively reflect economic conditions and inform decisions both for government policy and individual financial planning. If you have specific parts you'd like more detail on or questions about how this affects different stakeholders, feel free to ask!	2024-12-16 00:42:19.345499	\N	0
24a8be61-c2ae-4a38-98f5-e7b3e724332f	\N	assistant	I can certainly provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis based on the excerpt provided from "The Return of the King." Let’s delve into different aspects of the passage:\n\n### The Arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl\n\n- **Imagery and Atmosphere:** The passage sets a dark and oppressive tone with the introduction of the Lord of the Nazgûl. His arrival underlines the gravity of the situation at Minas Tirith, emphasizing the direness of the siege. The Nazgûl is described as towering and menacing, highlighting his role as a significant antagonist and the embodiment of menace in the narrative.\n\n### Gandalf's Defiance\n\n- **Characterization of Gandalf:** Gandalf’s steadfastness in this scene symbolizes the resilience and resistance of good against evil. By having Gandalf command, "You cannot enter here," the text underscores his role as a guardian and protector, embodying courage and moral fortitude. This confrontation is not just physical; it is also a clash of wills and ideals.\n\n### The Unveiling of the Nazgûl\n\n- **Symbolism and Fear:** The unveiling of the Nazgûl, particularly the revealing of a crown without a head, symbolizes the chilling essence of fear and the perversion of power. The invisible head beneath the crown signifies the emptiness and void at the heart of evil, suggesting that the Nazgûl’s power is both spectral and insidious.\n- **Psychological Conflict:** The deadly laughter and the raising of the flaming sword introduce a psychological dimension to the confrontation, portraying the Nazgûl’s attempt to break Gandalf’s spirit through intimidation.\n\n### The Unexpected Turning Point\n\n- **Role of the Cock:** The crowing of the cock acts as a catalyst for change at this narrative juncture. It serves as a natural symbol of dawn and renewal, introducing a sense of hope. This small event disrupts the tension and sets off a change in events, suggesting that even minor elements play crucial roles in the struggle against overwhelming darkness.\n  \n### Rohan's Arrival\n\n- **Symbol of Hope:** The sound of Rohan’s horns bolsters this newfound hope, indicating that help is on the way. This doesn’t just signal a strategic shift; it encapsulates the theme of alliance and unity, which is essential for triumph over evil. The reinforcement from Rohan highlights the importance of camaraderie and shared struggle.\n\n### Key Themes\n\n- **Good vs. Evil:** The confrontation between Gandalf and the Nazgûl captures the story's overarching theme of good versus evil. Gandalf represents the resilience of good, holding firm against the malignancy embodied by the Nazgûl.\n- **Hope vs. Despair:** The excerpt adeptly balances peril with promise. While the presence of the Nazgûl brings forth despair, the humble crowing of the cock and the ensuing arrival of the Rohan army rekindle hope.\n- **Symbolism:** Elements like the shadow, fire, and abyss are interwoven throughout the scene, enhancing its symbolic richness. Sounds, such as the cock’s crow and the horns of Rohan, serve to elevate the dramatic tension and thematic layers within the passage.\n\nThis excerpt is a prime example of Tolkien’s mastery in combining symbolism, character dynamics, and themes to enrich the narrative’s depth and emotional impact. It juxtaposes overarching darkness with subtle signals of hope, underscoring the influence of both grand and minor players in the story’s climax.	2024-12-16 01:21:42.869603	null	0

13c55be9-a38d-41d0-9a4a-fd15d765a938	\N	assistant	Certainly! Here is a detailed exploration of how inflation is measured through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), highlighting the complexities and nuances involved in this process:\n\nInflation measurement is a fundamental economic process that tracks changes in the overall price level of goods and services within the economy over time. This involves far more than a simple comparison between past and current prices due to the diversity and dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and market trends. One of the key instruments for measuring inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) is the mainstay of this measurement, tracking price changes specifically for urban consumers—who make up about 93% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe journey to calculating the CPI begins with selecting a 'basket' of goods and services that reflects the typical consumption patterns of American households. This basket is comprehensive, encapsulating a wide range of items from daily necessities like groceries and gasoline to services like healthcare and cable television. The composition of this basket is determined by the Consumer Expenditures Survey, which assesses consumer spending habits across the country. This survey provides insights into which products should be included and their relative significance, ensuring that the index accurately reflects consumer priorities.\n\nEach item within this basket is assigned a specific weight denoting its importance relative to overall consumer spending. These weights are based on consumption frequency and expenditure share; for instance, changes in the price of commonly consumed items like chicken will carry more weight than less frequently purchased items like tofu. This weighted approach allows the CPI to more accurately reflect overall economic impact.\n\nData collection for the CPI is a meticulously coordinated effort. Every month, the BLS collects price information through two primary surveys: one covering most goods and services, and another focusing specifically on housing. For most goods and services, BLS representatives collect data either by visiting stores in person, contacting them by phone, or conducting online surveys. This process is especially frequent in major urban centers like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, where data collection occurs monthly for a detailed snapshot. Nationwide food and energy prices are also updated monthly, while other locations are updated bi-monthly.\n\nFor housing, a significant component of consumer expenses, the BLS gathers prices from approximately 50,000 residences. This is done through personal visits or phone surveys, with a unique focus on "owners' equivalent rent" for owner-occupied properties. This approach estimates what it would cost to rent a similar property, compensating for the fact that actual rents don't necessarily change month-to-month. Since rents exhibit more gradual changes, each sampled housing unit is revisited biannually, a strategy that expands the scope of housing data while acknowledging the relative price stability of the sector.\n\nUpon gathering the requisite price data, the BLS calculates the CPI by comparing current prices against those of a predefined base period. This calculation is repeated and reported monthly, capturing changes that might indicate inflationary trends. For example, the CPI might show a 1.3% increase from May to June 2022, an indication of slight inflationary movement which, however, may be nuanced by temporary or seasonal factors. While these monthly reports might exhibit volatility, the year-over-year comparison—another common analytical approach adopted by the BLS—provides a steadier view. By comparing the CPI of a specific month to its counterpart from the previous year (e.g., July 2022 to July 2021), the BLS highlights the cumulative 12-month inflation rate, smoothing out one-off price spikes or drops.\n\nThis comprehensive methodology ensures that the CPI is not merely a snapshot of price trends but a reliable economic indicator that informs both policy-making and public understanding of inflation dynamics. Despite its robustness, the CPI is not without limitations; for instance, it does not perfectly capture the diversity of individual consumer experiences. Additionally, specialized versions like the CPI for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) are pivotal for indexing Social Security benefits to inflation, illustrating the practical applications of this measurement in social and economic policy.\n\nThrough this rigorous and multi-faceted process, the CPI remains a cornerstone of economic analytics, offering valuable insights into inflationary pressures that influence everything from central bank interest rate decisions to wage negotiations and household budgeting strategies.	2024-12-16 07:26:37.873008	null	0

This document focuses on analyzing the role of the character Gradus in Vladimir Nabokov's novel *Pale Fire*. It employs a mathematical framework of "projection" and "unprojection" to explore the novel's structure and meaning.\n\n**Projection and Unprojection:**\n\nThese concepts are used both in literature and mathematics. In Freudian psychology, projection refers to attributing one's feelings to another, while mathematically, it involves transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one, akin to flattening a 3D object to a 2D space. Notably, once reduced, reversing the process without additional information is challenging. This irreversibility is illustrated by Plato's cave allegory, where shadows alone cannot reveal their objects.\n\nIn literature, writing can be seen as "projection," distilling complex emotions into concise metaphors. Reading involves "unprojection," interpreting these metaphors to reconstruct their origins, relying on a shared understanding between author and reader. Paul de Man suggests writing and reading are intertwined processes, constantly negotiating meaning.\n\n**Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:**\n\nNabokov advances this concept by exploring the separation of consciousnesses, rather than merely interpreting narratives for higher dimensions. The novel intricately weaves Shade's poem as a projection and Kinbote's commentary as an unprojection attempt, creating a complex dynamic of shadows and reflections. Kinbote's interpretation, described as a "pale, lunar luminescence," transforms the poem's shadow into a new form.\n\n**Character Study of Gradus:**\n\nGradus symbolizes the novel's central themes, embodying contradictions and requiring exploration within the projection-unprojection framework. Though Kinbote mocks him as a mere reflection of Charles's journey, Gradus's role is more intricate. The analysis promises to delve deeper into his character, examining his contradictory nature through Nabokov's unique literary device.\n\nIn summary, the document suggests that *Pale Fire* is not just about narrative interpretation but an examination of interpretive processes through projection and unprojection, with Gradus playing a pivotal role in illustrating these themes.	2024-12-16 01:22:20.997741	null	0

Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of the key concepts discussed in the presentation on Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, particularly focusing on the terms "projection" and "unprojection," and how these apply to the character of Gradus.\n\nIn the context of the presentation, "projection" is used in both a psychological and mathematical sense. Psychologically, it involves attributing one's own feelings or thoughts to another person, a concept rooted in Freudian theory. Mathematically, projection refers to transforming a space of higher dimensions into a space of lower dimensions, like projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional plane. Importantly, this mathematical process often results in a loss of information; once something is projected, you cannot easily return to the original state without additional data, similar to how shadows can't give you the complete picture of the objects that cast them. This is akin to Plato’s cave allegory, where shadows on the wall are mere representations of the true forms.\n\nIn literature, the act of writing can be seen as a "projection downwards," where complex and multi-layered emotions or thoughts are condensed into metaphors or concise narratives. On the other hand, reading can be viewed as "unprojection," the process where readers interpret and reconstruct these narratives to glean the original depth of meaning. This requires a shared understanding or "code" between the author and reader and is inherently unstable, as interpretations can widely vary. The presentation references Paul de Man to emphasize the fluid nature of writing and reading where both acts traverse boundaries between creation and interpretation in complex, continuous negotiations of meaning.\n\nNabokov innovatively employs these concepts in *Pale Fire* by examining the separation and interplay of consciousnesses. Unlike earlier uses of unreliable narrators, Nabokov separates consciousness not by interpreting a higher dimension, but by examining the interpretive functions themselves. The novel weaves an intricate relationship between John Shade's poem and Charles Kinbote's commentary - the poem as projection and Kinbote’s comments as an attempt at unprojection, which adds layers of interpretation, almost like a secondary work emerging from the primary. This creates a complex layer of meaning, a shadow and reflection dynamic, as Kinbote's version and understanding influence how the poem is perceived and understood, described here as a "pale, lunar luminescence."\n\nAs for the character Gradus, the presentation suggests that his role is a reflection of these thematic concerns. While Kinbote sees Gradus as a simplistic figure, perhaps mocking him as a one-dimensional antagonist, the presentation argues that Gradus is much more complex. His nature is thoroughly entangled in the exploration of projection and unprojection. Kinbote's representation of Gradus is another projection, which might distort the reader’s perception if taken at face value. Therefore, Gradus's character and actions call for deeper analysis to fully understand his embodiment of the novel's central motifs and Nabokov's intent with this unique narrative strategy. By examining Gradus through the lens of projection and unprojection, one can appreciate his broader significance in the narrative, functioning as another form of interpretive shadow, integral to exploring the limits and layers of understanding and meaning constructed by Nabokov.\n\nI hope this helps clarify and dive deeper into the themes and ideas of the presentation!

While the document we're focusing on is an excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King," I can help you understand how themes from the text might relate to your concern.\n\nIn the excerpt, one of the central themes is the balance between hope and despair, represented by Gandalf's confrontation with the Lord of the Nazgûl. This mirrors real-world struggles where oppressive forces might attempt to quash freedom, including free speech.\n\nThe unexpected intervention of the cock's crow and Rohan's arrival symbolizes hope and resilience. Similarly, in the face of crackdowns on privacy websites, advocacy for free speech and privacy can serve as a counterbalance to more oppressive actions.\n\nThis parallel can suggest that, like Gandalf, individuals and organizations can stand firm against adversities, using seemingly small acts to create significant positive change. However, the specifics of how privacy website crackdowns affect free speech would depend on the context—such as the laws involved and the intentions of those enforcing them, which aren't detailed in this document.

3692c8b5-6f88-4047-bb78-f5aa1698be40	\N	assistant	Certainly! Here's a detailed analysis of the excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" that covers various thematic and symbolic elements:\n\nThis excerpt portrays a pivotal and dramatic confrontation between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl at the gates of Minas Tirith, serving as a microcosm for the broader conflict in Tolkien's epic.\n\n**The Arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl:**\nThe arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl is depicted with an aura of menace and dread. His presence breaches an archway that no enemy has penetrated before, symbolizing the encroachment of darkness into a space that was thought impregnable. This imagery sets the scene for an overwhelming sense of peril, emphasizing the Nazgûl's power and the dire situation facing Minas Tirith.\n\n**Gandalf's Defiance:**\nIn stark contrast, Gandalf's defiance stands as a beacon of resilience and courage. His refusal to flee and his steadfast position on Shadowfax demonstrate his role as a guardian of hope and light. Gandalf's command, "You cannot enter here," is an assertion of the power of good against evil, embodying the core theme of Tolkien's narrative, which is the enduring struggle between these forces.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\nThe Black Rider's dramatic unveiling—his hood thrown back to reveal a crown with no visible head—distills the essence of his character: an absence of identity, consumed by malice and power. The deadly laughter from the unseen mouth further enhances his sinister nature, while his boasting and challenge to Gandalf highlight his overconfidence and arrogance.\n\n**The Unexpected Turning Point:**\nThis confrontation reaches a crucial turning point with the simple crowing of a cock, a symbol of dawn and renewal. The juxtaposition of this everyday sound against the fantastical backdrop underlines an important theme: the power of seemingly insignificant acts to alter the course of events. The crow heralds the dawn, signifying hope's return just when the darkness seems overpowering.\n\n**Rohan's Arrival:**\nThe subsequent sound of Rohan's horns solidifies the shift in momentum. The arrival of the Rohan army injects hope and reinforces the theme of unity and strength through alliance. It signifies the rallying of forces of good against the tide of darkness, epitomizing the collective struggle against evil.\n\n**Key Elements and Themes:**\n1. **Good vs. Evil:** Gandalf and the Nazgûl represent the fundamental conflict of light versus darkness, with Gandalf's stand underscoring the theme of moral fortitude against overwhelming odds.\n2. **Hope vs. Despair:** The balance between the threat posed by the Nazgûl and the symbols of hope such as the cock's crow and the Rohan horns paints a picture of tension between despair and renewal.\n3. **Unexpected Intervention:** The intervention of small, seemingly insignificant events (the crowing of the cock) disrupts the narrative's darkness, highlighting how hope can emerge unexpectedly.\n4. **Symbolism:** The rich use of imagery—such as shadow, fire, and the abyss—alongside auditory symbols like the cock's crow and horns, enhances the passage's thematic depth, creating dramatic tension.\n\nThis passage effectively weaves together these elements to create a moment of high-stakes tension, while also providing a turning point that shifts the narrative towards hope and the resurgence of good. Each component enriches the story's complexity, providing readers with a multifaceted tapestry of conflict, courage, and camaraderie.

e3ba7661-8fb9-4fd8-b41e-f459a7f3ed12	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nThe Ride of the Rohirrim\n\nNow silently, the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of Gondor, pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure. The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nstill Théoden gave no signal.\n\nYour role is to:\n1. Help users understand this section in detail\n2. Focus particularly on the highlighted portion\n3.

Let's break it down further to make it more manageable:\n\n1. **Focus on the Recent Changes:** If the memory leak appeared after recent changes, reviewing those modifications can sometimes quickly reveal the cause.\n\n2. **Break Down the Problem:**\n   - Work incrementally by checking smaller parts of your application.\n   - Try isolating modules or functions to see if the memory usage changes significantly.\n\n3. **Seek Help from Community:**\n   - Sometimes discussing the problem with peers or in developer forums (like Stack Overflow) can provide new insights or solutions.\n\n4. **Take Breaks:**\n   - Taking a step back can sometimes bring a fresh perspective and help you spot something you might have missed.\n\n5. **Simplified Tests:**\n   - Create test cases that replicate the leak with the smallest amount of code possible. This can often make tracing the problem easier.\n\nRemember, this is a common problem many developers face, and you're making progress by systematically working through it. If there's a specific part of the code or scenario you'd like to discuss, feel free to share that information for more tailored advice.	2024-12-16 05:33:59.136365	null	0

f04d56dc-243e-4b10-9b7b-38b281ffec1b	\N	assistant	Memory leaks can be quite challenging to identify and resolve, especially in complex systems. Let's approach this methodically:\n\n1. **Identify Leaks:**\n   Use profiling tools specific to your programming environment (e.g., Valgrind for C/C++, Memory Profiler for Python, or Chrome DevTools for JavaScript). These tools can help track memory allocation and deallocation to pinpoint leaks.\n\n2. **Review Code for Common Sources:**\n   - **Unmanaged Resources:** Ensure that resources like file handles, network connections, and database connections are properly closed after use.\n   - **Circular References:** In languages with garbage collection such as Python, circular references can prevent objects from being deallocated.\n   - **Poor Object Management:** In object-oriented codes, ensure that unnecessary objects are not being created or maintained longer than required.\n\n3. **Incremental Testing:**\n   Validate each part of your codebase individually. This can help isolate the section that's causing the memory growth.\n\n4. **Code Review:**\n   Have another set of eyes review the sections of your code that manage significant data operations or manage resource-heavy components.\n\n5. **Use Logging:**\n   Add detailed logging around memory-intensive operations to track when and what operations are happening, potentially uncovering patterns that lead to leaks.\n\nIf these steps bring up specific patterns or sections you need further help with, feel free to share code snippets or profiling outputs (avoiding sensitive information), and we can delve deeper into analysis and potential solutions.	2024-12-16 05:33:45.992892	null	0

One early appearance was at the Texas State Fair in the late 1930s, where vendors are said to have dipped sausages in cornmeal batter and fried them, serving them on sticks for easy handling. This innovation made them a popular fair treat due to their portability and taste.\n\nAnother claim comes from Carl and Neil Fletcher, who are credited with introducing the "corny dog" at the Texas State Fair in 1942. Meanwhile, the Pronto Pup, a similar corn-battered hot dog, appeared at the Minnesota State Fair in the early 1940s.\n\nEach claim highlights the regional fairs' influence in popularizing the corn dog, drawing on local palate preferences and the spirit of American innovation. Corn dogs exemplify the experimental approach to cuisine often found in fairgrounds, where foods are engineered to be both novel and easily consumable while walking around.	2024-12-16 05:36:29.725938	null	0

9ddf950a-8351-4a72-b5f4-3d39e00ce38a	\N	assistant	Inflation is measured by examining how the overall price level of goods and services evolves over time. One of the most comprehensive and widely used methods to measure inflation in the United States is through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI, specifically its primary version known as CPI-U, tracks price changes for urban consumers, covering about 93% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe process of measuring inflation via the CPI involves several intricate steps, making it more complex than a simple comparison of past and present prices. Let's delve into the process:\n\n1. **Selection of Goods and Services:** The BLS constructs a 'basket' of goods and services that represents the typical purchases of an average American consumer. This basket includes a wide array of items, such as gasoline, groceries, healthcare, and even services like cable TV. The selection of these items is crucial, as it represents consumer spending patterns and is based on the Consumer Expenditures Survey. This survey helps in determining which products are important to track, noting that products consumed more frequently (e.g., chicken) will have a greater weight in the index than those purchased less often (e.g., tofu).\n\n2. **Weighting of Items:** Each item in this basket is assigned a specific weight based on its importance to the average consumer's spending habits. This means that a price change in a heavily weighted item can have a more substantial impact on the overall CPI than a change in a less weighted one.\n\n3. **Price Data Collection:** Price data is collected monthly through two primary surveys. Most goods and services have prices recorded by BLS representatives who visit or contact stores nationwide. Locations like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, along with nationwide food and energy prices, are updated monthly, while other areas are updated bi-monthly.\n   \n   For housing, which is a significant part of consumer spending, the BLS visits or calls about 50,000 residences. To address owner-occupied homes, the "owners' equivalent rent" measure is used, approximating the rent cost for similar properties. Given that rent prices don't fluctuate dramatically from month to month, each housing unit is resampled every six months, allowing for wider geographical coverage in the data collection.\n\n4. **Calculation and Reporting:** Each month, the BLS calculates the CPI by assessing how the prices of basket items have fluctuated compared to a base period. The CPI reports this monthly, with variations such as a 1.3% increase from May to June 2022, for example. Although monthly indices can be volatile, extended period trends better reflect underlying inflation patterns.\n\n5. **Year-over-Year Comparison:** In addition to month-to-month tracking, the BLS compares the CPI of a given month to the same month of the previous year, offering a 12-month perspective on how prices have increased. This year-over-year approach helps mitigate the impact of isolated, unusually high or low monthly fluctuations, providing a more stable view of inflation.\n\nThis detailed process ensures that the CPI is a robust reflection of price changes across the economy, despite limitations like its inability to capture individual consumer experiences precisely. The CPI-W, a version of the CPI for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, is specifically used to adjust Social Security benefits, indicating the real-world implications of this measure. Overall, the CPI provides an essential indicator of inflation, shaping economic policy and personal financial decisions.	2024-12-16 07:26:18.601597	null	0

Projection refers to the transformation of a more complex entity into a simpler, reduced representation, while unprojection is the reverse process, recreating the original from the simpler form. \n\nIn the context of literature, writing is seen as 'projection'—condensing rich, complex layers of thought and emotion into metaphors or narrative. Reading, then, is 'unprojection', an exercise in decoding those compressed symbols to reconstitute the original layers of thought and emotion. This interplay of projection and unprojection forms the basis for understanding Nabokov's novel "Pale Fire".\n\nNabokov's novel does something truly innovative. Instead of just compressing and decompressing narratives (projection/unprojection), Nabokov adds a profound layer of complexity by separating 'consciousnesses'. He doesn’t just present a narrative for unprojection, he also critiques the act of interpretation itself, enhancing the narrative with an extra layer of complexity, essentially asking the reader to analyze the method of interpretation.\n\nThe novel is structured with a poem by Shade, serving as a projected object, and with commentary by Kinbote, which attempts to unproject. It is suggested that Kinbote's interpretation transforms Shade's poem into something different, a new creation born of the interplay between the core narrative and its interpretation. \n\nThe character of Gradus is integral to this thematic exploration. He's portrayed as a simplistic character by Kinbote, but the analysis suggests that Gradus's role is more complex. His character both reflects and contradicts the larger thematic environment of the novel, and future analysis will explore this in more depth, using the framework of projection and unprojection as a lens.\n\nOverall, the analysis is not just about what is projected, but also about understanding the interpretative approach embraced by the characters and by the reader. The novel, in effect, becomes a study of the very nature of narrative, interpretation, and meaning.	2024-12-16 08:13:02.151281	null	0

All flee except Gandalf, who sits steadfastly on Shadowfax before the Gate.\n\n**Gandalf's Defiance:**\n\nGandalf confronts the Lord of the Nazgûl, forbidding his entry:  "You cannot enter here," he commands, halting the approaching shadow.  He then forcefully urges the Nazgûl to return to the abyss prepared for him.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Black Rider throws back his hood, revealing a kingly crown, though no head is visible beneath it. A deadly laughter emanates from the unseen mouth.  The Nazgûl taunts Gandalf, boasting of his victory and challenging him to death. He raises his flaming sword.\n\n**The Unexpected Turning Point:**\n\nAt this crucial moment, a cock crows in a nearby courtyard, a simple, unassuming sound that heralds the approaching dawn. This seemingly insignificant event marks a turning of the tide.\n\n**Rohan's Arrival:**\n\nFollowing the cock's crow, distant horns sound from the slopes of Mount Mindolluin – the arrival of the Rohan army, offering hope and signifying the turning of the tide against the forces of darkness.\n\n\n**Key Elements and Themes:**\n\n* **Good vs. Evil:** The excerpt perfectly illustrates the central conflict of the story, with Gandalf, representing good, standing firm against the overwhelming evil of the Lord of the Nazgûl.\n* **Hope vs. Despair:** The scene balances the immense threat posed by the Nazgûl with the subtle yet powerful symbols of hope: the crowing cock and the sound of Rohan's horns.\n* **Unexpected Intervention:**  The seemingly insignificant act of a cock crowing disrupts the overwhelming power of the Nazgûl and foreshadows the arrival of reinforcements, highlighting the importance of seemingly small events.\n* **Symbolism:**  The use of imagery (shadow, fire, abyss) and sounds (the cock's crow, the horns) is rich in symbolism, contributing to the dramatic tension and thematic depth of the passage.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nNazgûl\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nearth beneath the City.\n\nYour role is to:\n1. Help users understand this section in detail\n2. Focus particularly on the highlighted portion\n3.

However, based on the text provided, the document presents an intriguing analytical framework for understanding Nabokov's "Pale Fire". The concepts of projection and unprojection offer a unique lens through which to explore narrative construction and the interpretive roles of author, reader, and characters within a text. Applying these mathematical and psychological concepts to literature provides a fresh perspective, potentially revealing new layers of meaning in Nabokov's novel. The text suggests a rich interplay between Shade's poem (the 'projection') and Kinbote's commentary (the 'unprojection'). The character of Gradus appears to embody these complex interpretive dynamics, suggesting further directions for in-depth character analysis.	2024-12-16 08:13:23.591366	null	0
3f5e9649-fb79-4409-bb9f-c542a55d32fa	\N	assistant	Certainly, this document is a structured summary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, broken down into distinct sections.\n\nSection I, the Preamble, sets the stage for the rest of the document. It stresses the right of people to dissolve their political bonds with a government if they feel it is needed and discusses the principle of being equal amongst all nations. This section is significant as it introduces the philosophy that underpins the entire Declaration. Importantly, it grounds these beliefs in the laws of nature and of a divine entity, thus granting them an authority that transcends human construct.\n\nSection II details the document's core principles. They include equality for all men, certain unalienable rights (including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness), and the idea that the government's role is to secure these rights, with power derived from the consent of the governed. Crucially, it asserts the people's right to alter or abolish a government that becomes destructive towards these rights. It underlines the seriousness of revolution, suggesting it as a reserved right in the face of a long train of abuses potentially leading to despotism. \n\nThe third section is a list of grievances that the American colonists had with King George III and the British Government. These grievances, grouped into categories of legislative interference, obstruction of population and justice, as well as military oppression and subjugation, establish the key argument: that King George III systematically denied the colonists their rights and disregarded their welfare, from obstructing beneficial laws and misusing legislative powers to maintaining peace-time standing armies and imposing military power. These listed infringements provide the contextual evidence of the transgressions of the British rule and demonstrate the collective burden that validated the drastic step towards independence.\n\nThe movements of the summary culminate in the final section, the Declaration of Independence. Here, the colonies formally declare their independence and mark their transition from a territory to a sovereign entity. This act, seen as necessary to secure the people's unalienable rights, rests on the previously outlined principles, emphasizing principles of liberty and self-governance. The conclusion encapsulates the document's purpose: to justify the colonies' decision and to articulate the principles that would guide the new nation.\n\nThis document analysis, overall, confirms the Declaration of Independence as a crucial artifact in political thinking. Its principles of individual rights, the role of government, and the right of the governed to challenge their government, lay the groundwork for democratic frameworks globally.	2024-12-16 08:13:14.737762	null	0

For example, in literature, writing is a form of projection, where complex emotions are condensed into concise metaphors, and reading is an unprojection, where these metaphors are interpreted and their multidimensional origins are reconstructed. This section also makes an interesting claim about the precarious nature of the shared code between author and reader, suggesting that interpretation varies depending on individual perspective.\n\n2. **Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:** Here, the document underscores Nabokov's innovative approach to the projection/unprojection paradigm. Using *Pale Fire* as an example, it points out that the novel separates consciousnesses, exploring not just interpretation but the interpretive process itself. There's a sophisticated dance between Shade's poem (the projection) and Kinbote's commentary (the unprojection), which results in a nuanced interplay of "shadows and reflections."\n\n3. **Gradus: A Character of Contradictions:** Gradus, a character in *Pale Fire*, embodies the theme of the presentation: the duality of perception, or the tension between projection and unprojection. The document highlights that while Gradus is initially presented as a character reduced to a mere reflection of Kinbote's narrative, his role is much more complex and requires further investigation.\n\nThroughout these sections, this document proposes the creative use of mathematical principles as a lens of analysis in understanding literature, specifically in the interpretation of Nabokov's work *Pale Fire*. This analytical approach offers an innovative method to scrutinize the narrative layers and the author's literary technique.\n\nPlease let me know if there is a specific part you would like to delve deeper into.	2024-12-16 08:16:43.213844	null	0

50d401d0-ca1e-4e87-8837-17e7f871e85d	\N	assistant	Absolutely, the document is a structure summary of the United States Declaration of Independence, made up of four main sections: the Preamble, the Core Principles, the Grievances Against King George III, and the Conclusion.\n\n1. **Preamble: The Right to Separate**\nThe preamble of the Declaration emphasizes that it is a natural and god-given right for a people to sever political ties with another entity and establish an independent nation. It was deemed necessary to respectfully explain the reasons for this separation.\n\n2. **Core Principles: Self-Evident Truths**\nAccording to the document, the core values that formed the foundation of the United States' Declaration of Independence are:\n    - All men are created equal.\n    - The rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable.\n    - The purpose of government is to safeguard these rights.\n    - Governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed.\n    - When a government becomes destructive of these rights, the people have the right to alter or abolish it.\n\n3. **Grievances Against King George III**\nThe declaration further lists numerous grievances against King George III and the British government. These grievances prove a pattern of oppression justifying the colonies' demand for independence. The grievances are categorized into legislative interference, obstruction of population and justice, and military oppression and subjugation.\n\n4. **Conclusion: Declaration of Independence**\nFinally, the document summed up the standing sentiment at the time: A declaration that the thirteen American colonies were independent of British rule to safeguard the unalienable rights of the American people and to establish a new government based on the principles of freedom and self-governance.\n\nThe structured summary of the Declaration of Independence aims at enhancing readability while preserving its original essence and meaning. It's an important document, setting the precedent for many countries in their fight for independence, human rights, and self-governance.	2024-12-16 08:16:43.924441	null	0
f63c9807-7953-480e-b07e-762bb5c7c377	\N	assistant	Sure, I'm glad to delve deeper into each section of this document:\n\n1. **Preamble: The Right to Separate**: The preamble in this document is key because it not only sets the stage for the rest of the Declaration but also outlines the philosophical underpinnings of the Declaration. The idea that all individuals have the right to separate from an oppressive government reconciles with the principles of the Enlightenment period, heavily influencing the Founding Fathers.\n\n2. **Core Principles: Self-Evident Truths**: The core principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence embodied the concept of natural rights – the idea that every individual was born with fundamental rights that could not be violated by any government. This was a departure from the monarchical tradition where rights were granted by the crown. The notion that governments were formed to protect these rights and derived their powers from the people set the stage for democratic governance.\n\n3. **Grievances Against King George III**: The document detailed significant oppressive actions by British King George III which were seen as violations of fundamental rights. They were articulated across three main categories:\n\n   **A. Legislative Interference**: This included the refusal to assent to certain laws that were favorable to the public, interfering in legislative bodies, and refusing to allow new elections once representative houses were dissolved.\n\n   **B. Obstruction of Population and Justice**: This entailed blocking population growth, obstructing justice by not agreeing to laws that established judiciary powers, and sending officials to exploit and harass colonists, among other grievances.\n\n   **C. Military Oppression and Subjugation**: Actions like maintaining peace-time armies without legislative consent, making military authority supersede civil power, subjecting colonies to jurisdiction they didn't recognize, and more.\n\n4. **Conclusion: Declaration of Independence**: The conclusion of the Declaration summarizes its main purpose: declaring the American colonies as free and independent from British rule. The document stated this as a necessary step to protect the asserted unalienable rights of the people, forming a new government rooted in liberty and self-governance. \n\nThis document, while specifically related to the American Revolution, holds universal significance as an assertion for the right of a people to self-determination and governance based on consent. It shaped ideas of democracy and human rights globally.	2024-12-16 08:17:54.167685	null	0

ff17a832-7d26-48f1-8d1f-f374828d5f6c	\N	assistant	Absolutely, I can expand on the analysis of this excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King." Let's delve into the key components and themes presented in the passage:\n\n### **The Confrontation Scene:**\nThe excerpt showcases a pivotal confrontation between two potent figures, Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl, at the gates of Minas Tirith. This scene encapsulates the central theme of **Good vs. Evil**, with Gandalf embodying the forces of good standing defiantly against the malevolent presence of the Nazgûl. Gandalf’s posture, steadfast and calm upon Shadowfax, symbolizes the resilience and steadfastness of good even in the face of seemingly insurmountable evil.\n\n### **Gandalf's Defiance:**\nGandalf's command, "You cannot enter here," is not just a physical barrier but a moral and symbolic stand. Here, Gandalf asserts the boundaries of light against encroaching darkness. His words are reinforced by his actions and presence, depicting the powerful symbolism of heroes stepping forward to safeguard hope and life.\n\n### **The Nazgûl's Might:**\nThe unveiling of the Nazgûl, with a kingly crown atop an invisible head, underscores a chilling presence of power and dread without form, suggesting the formlessness and all-encroaching nature of tyranny and fear. His laughter and challenge project the confidence of evil in its victory, elevating the tension of the scene.\n\n### **Symbolism and Intervention:**\nThe intervention of the cock's crow is a masterstroke of subtlety by Tolkien, utilizing it as a symbol of hope and change. This simple, everyday sound breaks through the tension, symbolizing the dawn and new beginnings against the darkness of night. It subtly underlines the theme of **Hope vs. Despair**, showing that even in the direst situations, change and salvation can emerge unexpectedly.\n\n### **Rohan's Arrival:**\nThe subsequent arrival of the Rohan army, signaled by the horns from the slopes of Mount Mindolluin, acts as a physical reinforcement of the symbolic hope introduced by the cock's crow. This development not only provides a strategic turning point in the battle but resonates with the narrative's heroic and kinship themes—how alliances and unity in times of struggle can alter the tide against adversity.\n\n### **Imagery and Themes:**\nThe excerpt is rich with imagery such as shadow, fire, and the abyss, which deepens the symbolic layers and thematic exploration. These elements highlight the epic struggle pervasive throughout the narrative, embellishing the passage with a multifaceted look at the conflict’s moral and emotional dimensions. The sound imagery, especially the contrast between the Nazgûl’s threatening voice and the natural world’s hopeful signs, underscores Tolkien’s use of environmental elements to mirror and amplify the story’s emotional beats.\n\nIn summary, this passage exemplifies Tolkien’s skill in weaving a narrative that balances tension, symbolism, and thematic depth, engaging readers in both the immediate drama and the larger philosophical battles at play.

628894ad-84b6-4751-b1b0-6ca6ee6728ae	\N	assistant	Certainly. This document is discussing the concept of inflation and how it's measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Here are the main points.\n\n1. **Inflation:** Inflation represents the changes in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. It's calculated by comparing current prices to past prices.\n\n2. **Consumer Price Index (CPI):** CPI is the most used measure for inflation. It's produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and primarily tracks price changes for urban consumers, thus representing about 93% of the U.S. population. Their experiences are averaged so the CPI doesn't reflect individual experiences. It's calculated monthly using data from 80,000 items in a basket of goods and services representing typical American purchases.\n\n3. **Basket Contents and Weighting:** The basket includes items such as groceries, gasoline, cable TV, and healthcare. Each item is weighted in the basket based on its importance to an average consumer, determined using the Consumer Expenditures Survey.\n\n4. **Data Collection:** The BLS collects price data monthly via two surveys: one for most goods and services, and another specifically for housing. Data collection extends across various stores nationwide and to 50,000 residences for housing prices.\n\n5. **CPI Reporting:** The BLS reports monthly price changes. It may report changes from one month to the next, or it may compare the CPI of a month to the same month a year ago. While the monthly CPI can vary greatly, the trend over several months or the year-on-year comparison provide a clearer picture of inflation. Both methods are considered accurate.\n\nHence, the CPI is crucial for understanding inflation trends and adjusting benefits such as Social Security in concert with inflation.	2024-12-16 08:18:41.529258	null	0
6f2be4ea-4797-49dc-877b-016a6f2bcb23	\N	assistant	The highlighted word "representing" refers to Gandalf as a representation or symbol of good in the excerpt. In the scene, Gandalf, by standing firm against the Lord of the Nazgûl, embodies and represents the forces of good in the clash against the overwhelming evil personified by the Nazgûl. This representation is a key element in the theme of good versus evil, which is central to the excerpt.	2024-12-20 03:28:30.354506	null	0

Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" series. Specifically, in this excerpt, it refers to the Lord of the Nazgûl, who is the most powerful of the Ringwraiths and serves as Sauron's chief lieutenant. He is also known as the Witch-King of Angmar. The Nazgûl are former human kings who were corrupted by the power of Sauron's rings, becoming wraiths bound to his will. The confrontation in this excerpt portrays the balance of power between the forces of good, represented by Gandalf, and the unsettling presence of the Nazgûl, symbolizing the oppressive might of evil.	2024-12-20 03:28:20.138019	null	0

Better Intuition:\n- The document explicitly states "Don't think of matrices as a collection of numbers" and instead encourages viewing "columns as vectors in a high dimensional space"\n- While we might lack natural intuition when moving from R¹ to R² to R³ and beyond, thinking in terms of vectors helps develop better understanding of higher dimensional spaces\n\n2. Conceptual Framework:\n- Linear algebra provides "machinery for dealing with, discussing, and gaining intuition about vectors in high dimensional spaces"\n- This perspective aligns with the document's philosophy that "vector spaces are good" while "matrices are bad"\n\n3. Practical Applications:\n- The document demonstrates this through a concrete example of a system of equations that can be represented in matrix form\n- This vector-space approach helps us understand the three possible outcomes of linear systems (unique solution, no solution, or infinite solutions)\n\n4. Mathematical Abstraction:\n- By moving away from just numbers to vectors, we can better grasp the underlying structure and behavior of linear systems\n- This approach appears to be particularly valuable when dealing with higher-dimensional problems where direct numerical visualization becomes impossible\n\nThe document suggests this perspective shift from numbers to vectors is fundamental to understanding linear systems, particularly as we move into higher dimensions where our natural intuition falls short.	2025-01-03 18:47:23.592749	null	0

It's crucial, however, to recognize the importance of these concepts from an economic and policy perspective. \n\n1. **Understanding Inflation:** Inflation affects nearly all sectors of an economy. High inflation can reduce purchasing power and create uncertainty, while low or negative inflation (deflation) can lead to reduced economic activity. Hence, gauging inflation accurately is important for economic stability.\n\n2. **CPI's Role:** CPI is central to making informed policy decisions. It helps in understanding how prices are changing for average consumers and consequently informs fiscal and monetary policy decisions. Adjustments to wages, pensions, and benefits often link to CPI to maintain their real value.\n\n3. **Reflecting the Economy:** The process of calculating the CPI, though complex, aims to accurately reflect the consumption patterns of a majority of the U.S. population by creating a weighted “basket” of goods and services.\n\nIn summary, the process is not "silly," but rather a thorough and methodical approach to understand and respond in real-time to changes in the economic climate of a country.	2024-12-16 08:19:15.884913	null	0

75c3ab27-a535-4be4-a3ee-1e2141a6601e	\N	assistant	Certainly! Let's dive into a detailed analysis of the excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" that depicts the confrontation between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl at Minas Tirith. \n\n### Setting the Scene\n\nThe excerpt begins by describing the dramatic arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl, setting a dark and ominous tone. His entry through an archway "never before breached by an enemy" emphasizes the severity of the threat and establishes the high stakes of the encounter. Minas Tirith stands as the last line of defense, and Gandalf's resolve becomes a central focus in the narrative.\n\n### Gandalf’s Defiance and Themes of Good vs. Evil\n\nGandalf represents the embodiment of good, steadfast on Shadowfax, a symbol of purity and strength, as he confronts the Lord of the Nazgûl. His command, "You cannot enter here," serves not just as a physical barrier but also as a moral stance against the encroaching darkness. This interaction highlights the overarching theme of good versus evil, where Gandalf's determination underscores the resilience of good.\n\n### The Unveiling of the Nazgûl\n\nThe dramatic unveiling of the Nazgûl—revealing a crown without a head—further enhances the sense of dread and his otherworldly nature. The laughter from an unseen mouth adds to the fear, showcasing the Nazgûl's confidence and taunting nature. This confrontation places Gandalf against a seemingly insurmountable evil, highlighting the tension inherent in such cosmic battles.\n\n### Hope vs. Despair\n\nThe excerpt masterfully balances the tension of despair with the emergence of hope. Just as the Nazgûl prepares to strike, the unexpected sound of a cock crowing pierces the darkness. This simple creature's crow suggests the arrival of dawn—a metaphor for hope and renewal. It signals an interruption in the Nazgûl's dominance, illustrating Tolkien's theme of light overcoming darkness.\n\n### Rohan's Arrival\n\nAs the cock crows, the sound of Rohan's horns follows. The arrival of the Rohan army signifies salvation and reinforces the turning tide against evil. This event underscores the solidarity and courage of the free peoples of Middle-earth. It also demonstrates that even in the darkest moments, there is potential for alliance and collective action to reverse despair.\n\n### Unexpected Intervention and Symbolism\n\nThe excerpt highlights the power of seemingly small actions to change the course of events. The cock's crow represents unforeseen interventions that can disrupt evil's power. This notion is deeply rooted in Tolkien's theme of the insignificant playing a significant role in the grand narrative.\n\nIn terms of symbolism, imagery such as "shadow," "fire," and "abyss" enriches the passage. The Nazgûl's flaming sword and the shadow he casts heighten the sense of menace, contrasting with the natural signs of hope: the cock and the horns. These elements add layers to the thematic exploration of good edging out evil.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis passage is a microcosm of "The Lord of the Rings," reflecting the broader narrative struggles and underscoring fundamental themes of good versus evil, hope amidst despair, and the importance of small, unexpected interventions. It’s a testament to Tolkien’s ability to weave tension, symbolism, and thematic depth into his storytelling, making these moments resonate with the reader both emotionally and intellectually.\n\nFeel free to explore specific aspects of this analysis further or ask additional questions!	2024-12-17 21:19:37.597617	null	0

3cf81bc8-4b15-4283-8e2a-4fec3e5eda6c	\N	assistant	It sounds like you're referencing the Declaration of Independence or expressing a sentiment akin to it. The Declaration itself meticulously establishes the philosophical and practical justifications for the American colonies' separation from British rule. Let's delve deeper into its sections:\n\n1. **Preamble**: Emphasizes the colonies' right to break away and form an independent nation, citing both the laws of nature and those given by God as justifications.\n\n2. **Core Principles**: Introduces the famous assertion that all men are created equal, with unalienable rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It also legitimizes revolution against a government that fails to protect these rights.\n\n3. **Grievances Against King George III**: Lists specific complaints about the king's actions, portraying them as oppressive and tyrannical, thereby justifying the need for independence.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Formally declares the colonies as independent states, committed to self-governance and the protection of their unalienable rights.\n\nIf you want to explore a specific part or discuss how its philosophical underpinnings might apply to today's context, let me know!	2024-12-17 21:48:01.632564	null	0

then her hazel brown eyes would light up with the same warmth of the hearth flame that illuminated her face, and she’d make her way over to the sofa where I was, snuggle up against my shoulder, make the words on the page come to life, and I would be filled.\nIt was my facial expressions, my hand gestures, the slightest glances to the left and to the right, she understood all of it, it took no effort on her part and was so extraordinary that she very well may have been reading not the story in the book, but rather the inscriptions of my soul.\nYou told me yourself that even you couldn’t come close to comprehending me in that way.\nBut then she’d be turning the pages, and I’d remember that every good story has an end, that her gift was a crutch I would one day have to set to the side so I could stand on my own two feet, and I’d feel empty again.\nIt has been a long time since I have heard you tell us anything.\nWhen we were ten, you had to go back to China.\nWàipó fell ill with [fill in specific] and needed your care.\nI also remember how hard it was for you when you lost your job in the states.\nThe one you found near Wàipó’s home was so much better than anything you could find here.\nI know it was a long and difficult decision, but eventually you found a caretaker to look after us and left the country.\nI’m sure anyone would’ve done the same if they were in your position.\nBesides, it let you be closer to Bàba.\nI don’t know much about him since he died when I was three, but I know you missed him very much.\nIt must be hard, taking care of Wàipó while providing for two children on the other side of the globe without his help.\nWhen money was running tight, Faith called you and said we didn’t need a caretaker anymore.\nShe said that she could take care of me, and that she could take care of herself.\nI know I can’t call you, Māma, but I should have texted you more than I did.\nSo I’m sorry.\nIt was the day you left, that at some point it was just you and me alone in the living room while Faith was in the bedroom doing a last check of the bags to make sure everything was ready for your long journey across the Pacific.\nDon’t get into trouble, don’t forget to text me.\nAnd take care of your sister, you told me.\nYou know I’ve always had good ears, and I could tell your words were slightly more hollow on the third instruction.\nIt was an unspoken and shared assumption that it was always going to very much be the other way around; I hated it nonetheless.\nBut it was after that, the last thing you told me before you left, that made quite the profound impression on me.\nWǒ ér zi, you told me, with a voice I have not heard so somber since the Saturday you picked out white chrysanthemums for Bàba’s funeral.\nWith li\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nWǒ ér zi\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

In this section of the presentation, Nabokov's *Pale Fire* is dissected using the concepts of projection and unprojection, borrowing terms from both psychology and mathematics.\n\n### Projection and Unprojection in Context\n1. **Psychological and Mathematical Projection:**\n   - **Psychological Projection:** The text references Freudian psychology where projection involves attributing one's emotions to someone else. This can be related to how narrators may project their own biases or feelings onto other characters or events in literature.\n   - **Mathematical Projection:** Here, projection is defined as the transformation of a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional one. This irreversible process without extra information is likened to Plato's cave allegory, implying that perspectives from a lower-dimensional space may omit crucial details.\n\n2. **Literary Application:**\n   - In literature, *projection* is viewed as condensing complex emotions into metaphors, whereas *unprojection* involves readers interpreting these metaphors to reconstruct their original meanings. This concept highlights the precarious nature of literary interpretation—dependent on a shared understanding between the author and reader.\n\n### Nabokov's Technique in *Pale Fire*\n1. **Innovative Separation:**\n   - Nabokov goes beyond compression and decompression seen in past literature, focusing instead on separating consciousnesses. The act isn’t just about elevating Kinbote’s narrative to a higher level but analyzing the mechanisms of interpretation themselves.\n   - Shade's poem acts as a projection, whereas Kinbote’s annotations attempt unprojection. However, rather than clarifying the poem, Kinbote's interpretations introduce new layers of meaning, transforming the narrative into an intricate tapestry of reality and imagination.\n\n### Gradus as a Central Figure\n1. **Character Complexity:**\n   - Though Kinbote mocks Gradus, reducing his journey to a mere shadow of Charles's grand illusions, Gradus’s role merits deeper analysis within the projection framework.\n   - Gradus represents the thematic contradictions and serves as a mirror, reflecting Nabokov's intricate narrative techniques. His seemingly simplistic representation contrasts with the deeper narrative mechanics at play, challenging readers to reconcile Kinbote's narrative with the unfolding events.\n\nThis section underscores the layered complexity in Nabokov's work, emphasizing how projection and unprojection serve as metaphors for interpretation, narrative construction, and reader engagement. It suggests considering not just the narrative itself but the processes that contribute to creating and interpreting literary meaning.	2024-12-18 21:46:32.960701	null	0

"Undivided" suggests wholeness or unity - there are no separations or fragments in this consciousness\n\n2. The consciousness of "this" refers to the awareness of objective reality - the ability to perceive and recognize things as "this" or "that"\n\n3. "Full of" indicates completeness or perfection - this consciousness fully permeates or encompasses everything\n\nIn context, this phrase is part of describing Mahesvara as the ultimate Self that exists in all beings. The text is explaining that this divine consciousness:\n- Is unified (not broken into parts)\n- Contains the ability to perceive everything \n- Is complete and all-encompassing\n\nThis is part of a philosophical explanation of how divine consciousness relates to all of existence and perception.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or explore how this connects to other parts of the passage?	2024-12-31 19:50:08.169276	null	0
9b0cc587-bf58-442a-abf4-a1ba545a325d	\N	assistant	While I am equipped to provide detailed analyses or responses, it's important to focus on maintaining clarity and relevance to your specific inquiry. If you have questions or need insight into "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" excerpt, I can certainly offer a comprehensive examination based on the provided chunk. For instance, we could explore the symbolic significance of Gandalf's confrontation with the Lord of the Nazgûl and the thematic elements at play. We could dissect how Tolkien uses imagery and sound to enhance the narrative or examine how these reflect broader themes within the work. By delving into the text, we might also consider the implications of Rohan's timely arrival, the juxtaposition of hope and despair, and what these narrative devices reveal about the characters and their arcs.\n\nThis passage is rich with insights. The dynamic between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgûl provides a classic depiction of the eternal struggle between good and evil. This is not only central to the plot but also serves as a microcosm of the larger battles that pervade the story. The seemingly simple sound of a cock crowing symbolizes unexpected hope in the face of imminent darkness, demonstrating Tolkien's skill in weaving small but significant elements into his narrative tapestry. This can also bring to mind the notion of "eucatastrophe," a term Tolkien coined which refers to a sudden turn of events leading to an uplifting conclusion. Furthermore, these elements underscore a recurring theme of the "unseen hands" at work, where forces beyond the characters' foresight intervene at critical junctures.\n\nIf there is a particular aspect you'd like further elaboration on, could you specify which element or theme interests you most?

f278ad11-22a1-4ead-bf58-f5d45940aa04	\N	assistant	Certainly! The excerpt you provided from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" offers a deep exploration of narrative techniques and thematic depth. One additional point of interest is the role of Gandalf in this scene. His steadfast position against the Lord of the Nazgûl is not only a testament to his courage but also aligns with his role as a guardian and protector of Middle-earth. This steadfastness in the face of overwhelming darkness underscores his wisdom and the strength of his character.\n\nMoreover, the scene's pacing and tension are expertly crafted. The build-up of the confrontation, the momentary pause brought by the cock's crow, and the subsequent heralding of Rohan's arrival create a rhythm that heightens the reader's emotional engagement. Tolkien's ability to weave hope into moments of despair reflects his broader message about resilience and the persistence of good, even in dire circumstances.\n\nFinally, considering the symbolic elements—the shadow and fire as embodiments of the opposing powers—adds another layer to the analysis. These elements not only portray the inherent conflict but also serve as visual and auditory motifs that anchor the reader in the scene's dramatic atmosphere.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to delve into another section or explore a different aspect of the text!	2024-12-18 09:54:30.612814	null	0

One fascinating component is how Nabokov constructs the interplay between the poem by John Shade and the commentary by Charles Kinbote. This dynamic serves as a primary example of the themes of projection and unprojection discussed in the document.\n\n**Interplay Between Poem and Commentary:**\n\nAt the heart of *Pale Fire* is the 999-line poem written by the fictional poet John Shade, with the narrative unfolding through Kinbote's exhaustive and often bizarre commentary. This structure transforms the novel into a metafictional experience, where the reader is not only interpreting Shade's poem but also navigating Kinbote's interpretation of it. This exemplifies the notion of "projection" as Shade projects his life's reflections and experiences into his poetic work, and "unprojection" as Kinbote seeks to reconstruct his understanding—or misinterpretation—of these reflections through his annotations.\n\n**Kinbote as Unprojector:**\n\nKinbote's commentary reveals as much about himself as it does about Shade's poem, showcasing his obsession and detachment from reality. He imposes his own fantasies and narratives, particularly about the imagined land of Zembla and his alter ego, King Charles, onto Shade's work. This duality renders Kinbote an unreliable narrator, blending Nabokov's literary innovation with the psychological concept of projection.\n\n**Theme of Literary Analysis Itself:**\n\nNabokov's novel itself becomes a commentary on the act of literary interpretation. The reader is drawn into the process of "reading as writing," as emphasized by Paul de Man. Through Kinbote's eccentric and misguided analysis, Nabokov challenges the reader to become an active participant, discerning the truth amid layers of fiction and delusion. This invites rich discussion on the nature of meaning-making in literature, a central theme in the document's analysis.\n\nThrough the novel's structure, Nabokov raises profound questions about authorship, interpretation, and reality, challenging traditional narrative forms. This makes the interplay between Shade's poem and Kinbote's commentary a particularly engaging part of *Pale Fire*, showcasing Nabokov's literary innovation and depth.	2024-12-18 09:55:30.987348	null	0

His obsession with his imagined kingdom and identity can be seen as a desire to assert independence from the reality around him—a reality he finds unfulfilling or oppressive.\n\nIn the context of the document, the projection and unprojection framework could be applied here: Kinbote's narrative might be a projection of his wishful thinking, where he seeks autonomy from his mundane existence as a literature professor by fabricating a separate identity. However, Nabokov challenges us to discern between these layers of reality and fiction, paralleling how the reader must navigate through Kinbote's independence claim and the actual narrative crafted by Shade's poem.\n\nIs there a specific aspect of this theme or another you're interested in exploring further?	2024-12-18 09:56:09.592534	null	0

Although this isn't directly related to Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, it does tie into broader themes of identity, autonomy, and the assertion of selfhood, which are present within the novel through its characters and narrative complexities.\n\nIf you'd like, I can draw parallels between the theme of declaring independence and elements within *Pale Fire*, or we could explore how notions of independence and self-determination are represented in the literary analysis within the document.

85f76e42-a8b8-4b16-b779-5f5bd4ccb795	\N	assistant	Certainly! Let's delve deeply into this excerpt from "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King."\n\nThis passage captures a pivotal moment of confrontation between Gandalf and the formidable Lord of the Nazgûl at the gates of Minas Tirith. This scene is fraught with tension and laden with rich symbolism that underscores the narrative's central themes.\n\n**The Arrival and Presence of the Lord of the Nazgûl:**\nThe description of the Lord of the Nazgûl establishes him as a menacing and otherworldly force. His approach under an archway "never before breached by an enemy" signifies the unprecedented threat his presence poses to Minas Tirith. The reaction of everyone but Gandalf—fleeing in fear—demonstrates the Nazgûl's power and the pervasive despair that grips the defenders.\n\n**Gandalf's Defiance:**\nGandalf's confrontation with the Nazgûl is a study in resilience and courage. His command, "You cannot enter here," is not just a physical defiance but a moral and symbolic stand against the encroaching darkness. Gandalf represents hope, wisdom, and steadfastness, embodying the resistance of good against overwhelming odds. His exhortation for the Nazgûl to "return to the abyss prepared for him" underlines a thematic thread where evil's dominion is ultimately transient and destined for downfall.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\nWhen the Nazgûl reveals his crown without a visible head, it emphasizes his spectral, inhuman terror. The deadly laughter that follows mocks Gandalf’s defiance and taunts the audience with a false sense of victory. The flaming sword suggests both a literal and metaphorical confrontation, poised to deliver death and destruction.\n\n**The Unexpected Turning Point:**\nThe crowing of a cock is a masterstroke of subtle narrative intervention. It functions as a mundane yet profound signal of hope. In literature, a cock's crow often heralds the dawn, symbolizing new beginnings and the end of darkness. Here, it disrupts the Nazgûl's overpowering presence, presaging change and injecting an understated yet powerful element of hope amid despair.\n\n**Rohan's Arrival:**\nThe distant horns of Rohan’s army are not merely a signal of military reinforcement but resonate symbolically with hope renewed. The sound from the slopes of Mount Mindolluin connects the seemingly isolated confrontation with broader movements within the story, indicating a pivotal shift in the battle's momentum and reinforcing the theme that good often arrives unexpectedly to counterbalance evil.\n\n**Key Elements and Themes:**\n1. **Good vs. Evil:** The confrontation crystallizes the epic struggle central to the narrative. Gandalf standing unmoved by fear mirrors a broader moral resistance against the darkness the Nazgûl embodies.\n2. **Hope vs. Despair:** Balanced within this scene is the palpable threat of evil and the persistent symbols of hope—the crow and the horns—serving as metaphorical anchors for the audience amid the story's tension.\n3. **Unexpected Intervention:** The cock’s crow serves as a narrative device that alters the scene's dynamics, evoking the potent theme that small, often overlooked actions can have significant effects, a recurrent motif in Tolkien's work.\n4. **Symbolism and Imagery:** The passage is rife with evocative imagery—shadow and fire, light and dark, sound and silence. These elements work in concert to heighten the drama and deepen the reader's engagement with the text's thematic richness.\n\nIn summary, this excerpt not only propels the plot but richly encapsulates the thematic essence of Tolkien’s epic, illustrating the intricate interplay between despair and hope, and highlighting the endurance of good in the face of seemingly insurmountable evil.	2024-12-18 21:39:58.815523	null	0

As outlined in the document:\n\n1. **Right to Separate**: The preamble emphasizes the inherent right to establish an independent status among nations when justified by oppressive circumstances (Section I).\n\n2. **Core Principles**: This decision was grounded in 'self-evident truths,' stressing equality, unalienable rights, and governance dependent upon the people's consent, highlighting the legitimacy of revolution under certain conditions (Section II).\n\n3. **Grievances**: A substantial list of grievances against King George III outlined a consistent pattern of abuses, arguing that these justified the separation due to the persistent denial of basic rights and refusal of legislative processes (Section III).\n\n4. **Declaration**: The conclusion of the document officially declares the colonies’ independence as a necessary step to protect their rights and establish self-governance (Section IV).\n\nThus, the declaration wasn't a whimsical act but a calculated response to prolonged infringements, asserting the colonies' entitlement to self-determination and governance.	2024-12-18 21:42:01.767538	null	0

All flee except Gandalf, who sits steadfastly on Shadowfax before the Gate.\n\n**Gandalf's Defiance:**\n\nGandalf confronts the Lord of the Nazgûl, forbidding his entry:  "You cannot enter here," he commands, halting the approaching shadow.  He then forcefully urges the Nazgûl to return to the abyss prepared for him.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Black Rider throws back his hood, revealing a kingly crown, though no head is visible beneath it. A deadly laughter emanates from the unseen mouth.  The Nazgûl taunts Gandalf, boasting of his victory and challenging him to death.

The government measures this by comparing current prices to past prices, a process more complex than it initially appears.\n\n### The Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\nThe most widely used inflation measure is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  The primary CPI (CPI-U) tracks price changes for urban consumers, representing 93% of the U.S. population.  It's an average, not reflecting individual consumer experiences.\n\nThe CPI is calculated monthly using data from 80,000 items in a fixed basket of goods and services representing typical American purchases. This basket includes items ranging from gasoline and groceries to cable TV and healthcare.  The BLS uses the Consumer Expenditures Survey to determine basket contents and item weighting, reflecting the relative importance of each item to the average consumer (e.g., chicken price changes have a greater impact than tofu price changes due to higher consumption).  A version of the CPI (CPI for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) is used to adjust Social Security benefits for inflation.\n\n\n### CPI Price Data Collection\n\nThe BLS collects monthly price data through two surveys: one for most goods and services, and one specifically for housing.\n\nFor most goods and services: BLS representatives (online or in person) or phone calls visit various stores nationwide, recording the prices of the same items each month.  New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago prices are collected monthly, as are nationwide food and energy prices.  Other locations are updated bi-monthly.\n\nFor housing: The BLS collects prices from 50,000 residences via personal visits or calls.  For owner-occupied homes, they use "owners' equivalent rent"—the estimated cost to rent a similar property—as the housing price.  Since rents change infrequently, each unit is sampled every six months, allowing broader housing coverage.\n\n\n### CPI Reporting\n\nThe BLS reports monthly price changes. For example, the CPI might increase by 1.3% from May to June 2022 (seasonally adjusted) but remain unchanged from June to July 2022.  While monthly CPI can be volatile, the trend over several months provides a better indication of inflation.\n\nAnother common report compares the CPI of a given month to the same month a year prior (e.g., July 2022 CPI compared to July 2021 CPI), showing the 12-month price increase.  This approach minimizes the impact of unusually high or low monthly changes.  Both reporting methods are considered accurate.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nThe CPI is calculated monthly using data from 80,000 items in a fixed basket of goods and services representing typical American purchases.

In Freudian psychology, it refers to the attribution of one's own feelings to another.  In a broader sense, it resembles the flattening of a three-dimensional image onto a two-dimensional surface.  Mathematically, projection is a function transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one (e.g., a cube projected onto a plane).  Crucially, this process is generally irreversible without additional information beyond the projection itself.  Think of Plato's cave allegory: shadows alone don't reveal the objects casting them. Similarly, a child viewing shadow puppets cannot reconstruct the puppets themselves from the shadows alone.\n\nLiterature, however, possesses a unique capacity. The act of writing can be viewed as a "projection downwards," condensing complex emotions into concise metaphors.  Reading, conversely, involves "unprojection"—interpreting these metaphors and reconstructing their multidimensional origins.  This unprojection relies on a shared code between author and reader, a pact whose stability is inherently precarious.  As Paul de Man suggests, reading is writing, and writing is reading, implying a constant, individual negotiation of meaning.\n\n**Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:**\n\nNabokov's predecessors explored the compression of objects into images (projection), and even, as seen in *Jane Eyre*, the process of decompression through unreliable narrators. However, Nabokov uniquely separates consciousnesses in *Pale Fire*, exceeding the capabilities of previous writers.  This is not about interpreting Kinbote's narrative to a higher dimension, but rather analyzing the *interpretive functions* themselves. The novel becomes a study of the interplay between Shade's poem (the projection), and Kinbote's commentary (the attempted unprojection), resulting in a complex interplay of shadows and reflections.  Kinbote's interpretation serves as a "pale, lunar luminescence," illuminating the poem's shadow and transforming it into something new.\n\n\n**Gradus: A Character of Contradictions:**\n\nGradus embodies the novel's central themes. Kinbote relentlessly mocks him, reducing him to a mere reflection of Charles's fantastical journey devoid of humanity. Yet, Gradus's role is far more complex and requires further investigation within the framework of projection and unprojection presented here.  The presentation will continue to explore this character in greater depth, analyzing his contradictory nature within the context of Nabokov's unique literary technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nUnprojection\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

When an author writes, they project intricate emotions and ideas into a condensed form. During reading, the process of unprojection occurs, where the reader interprets these condensed forms and attempts to reconstruct the original complexity. This requires a shared understanding or code between the author and the reader, though it remains a precarious and personal negotiation of meaning. In the context of Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, unprojection involves interpreting Kinbote's commentary on Shade's poem, transforming and expanding it beyond its straightforward presentation.	2024-12-19 01:58:18.595636	null	0

He enters riding under an archway of Minas Tirith that no enemy has ever breached before. His presence is so terrifying that everyone flees, except for Gandalf, who remains resolute. This scene establishes the Lord of the Nazgûl as a formidable and threatening figure, embodying the forces of darkness. The dramatic nature of his entrance sets the stage for the confrontation with Gandalf, emphasizing the looming danger and tension at the gates of the city.	2024-12-18 22:17:21.062294	null	0
84d2f3cb-ab49-4310-b052-5e9f625fcd17	\N	assistant	The Nazgûl, also known as the Ringwraiths or the Black Riders, are central antagonists in J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* series. They are nine former kings of men who were given Rings of Power by Sauron. Over time, these men became enslaved to the Dark Lord, losing their physical forms, existing as spectral beings bound to Sauron's will. They serve as his most feared and loyal servants, characterized by their haunting invisibility, dark cloaks, and relentless pursuit of the One Ring.\n\nIn the highlighted excerpt, the specific Nazgûl in focus is the Lord of the Nazgûl, also called the Witch-king of Angmar. He is the leader of the Nazgûl and one of Sauron's most powerful lieutenants. The text presents him as a towering, menacing figure, heightened by the dramatic unveiling of his form—or lack thereof—beneath the crown, which underscores his otherworldly and terrifying nature. His confrontation with Gandalf at the gates of Minas Tirith exemplifies the ultimate clash between the forces of darkness and the defenders of good, with the Nazgûl embodying despair and terror.	2024-12-18 22:18:54.80693	null	0

Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. **Projection and Unprojection in Context:**\n   - The text defines "projection" in various contexts. In psychology, it refers to attributing one's feelings to someone else, while in mathematics, it involves mapping higher-dimensional spaces to lower ones (such as projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional plane).\n   - In literature, writing can be seen as a projection where complex emotions are condensed into concise forms, and reading serves as an unprojection where the reader reconstructs those complexities.\n\n2. **Nabokov's Novel Structure:**\n   - *Pale Fire* is unique because it goes beyond typical narrative unreliability. It separates the consciousnesses of its characters, offering a layered interpretive experience.\n   - The poem by Shade serves as a projection, while Kinbote's commentary is an attempt at unprojection. This dynamic reflects Nabokov's exploration of interpretive functions rather than mere narrative.\n\n3. **Character Analysis – Gradus:**\n   - Gradus, a character often mocked within the novel, symbolizes this complex theme of projection and unprojection. Although Kinbote reduces him to a simplistic reflection, the text suggests a deeper, multifaceted role that aligns with the novel's exploration of identity and interpretation.\n\nThe section proposes a method of reading *Pale Fire* that underscores the intricacy of the relationship between writer and reader, as well as the multifaceted nature of its characters. This analysis encourages readers to consider not just the narrative itself, but the mechanisms of understanding and interpreting literature.

121da74a-df8b-42d0-b891-27ebe09c6758	\N	assistant	Certainly! Let’s delve deeper into the excerpt from "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" and explore its various narrative and thematic elements.\n\n### The Dramatic Confrontation\n\n**Arrival of the Lord of the Nazgûl**\n\nThis scene highlights the scale of threat as the Lord of the Nazgûl makes his entrance. Described as a towering and menacing figure, he embodies the overwhelming force of evil and darkness. His ability to breach the gates of Minas Tirith, a feat no enemy has achieved before, underscores the peril faced by the city and its defenders. Yet, Gandalf remains unwavering, signaling the resilience and steadfastness of those who defend the light.\n\n**Gandalf’s Defiance**\n\nGandalf’s confrontation with the Nazgûl is a pivotal moment, playing into the theme of good versus evil. His firm command, “You cannot enter here,” amidst the palpable threat, exemplifies courage and the power of righteousness. Gandalf’s presence becomes a bulwark against the tide of darkness. His attempt to repel the Nazgûl and send him back to the abyss accentuates his role as a guardian against the encroaching shadow.\n\n### The Unveiling and Taunting\n\nThe Nazgûl’s unveiling, where he reveals a crown with no visible head, adds a layer of supernatural horror and mystique. It serves as a reminder of his undead nature and the formidable challenge he represents. His mocking laughter in the face of confrontation exemplifies his disdain for the forces of good and his overconfidence in the battle's outcome. By raising his flaming sword, he threatens not just physical harm but also the spread of fear and despair.\n\n### The Unexpected Turning Point\n\nThe simple act of a cock crowing might seem mundane, but in this context, it acts as a powerful symbol of resilience and the natural order reasserting itself. It marks the dawn of a new day—a literal and metaphorical sign of hope. This moment signifies a shift in the narrative, reminding characters and readers alike that no darkness is impervious to light.\n\n### Rohan’s Arrival\n\nThe sound of Rohan's horns, following the cock’s crow, reinforces the theme of hope. Their arrival symbolizes timely intervention and the rallying of allies in the face of adversity. This bolsters the idea that, while evil may have its strongholds, unity and courage can destabilize even the most formidable of foes. The timely arrival of reinforcements is an uplifting moment, offering hope to both the characters and the audience.\n\n### Key Themes and Symbolism\n\n**Good vs. Evil**\n\nThe confrontation draws a stark line between the forces of good (Gandalf and his unyielding stance) and evil (the Nazgûl’s threats and mockery). This binary is central to the broader narrative of Middle-earth's struggle.\n\n**Hope vs. Despair**\n\nDespite the overbearing darkness introduced by the Nazgûl, small yet potent signs of hope disrupt this despair. The cock’s crow and Rohan’s arrival illustrate how simple acts or events can pivot the dynamics of power and inspire renewed courage.\n\n**Unexpected Intervention**\n\nThe narrative suggests that even in the direst scenarios, unforeseen elements (like the cock's crow) might turn the battle. This positions small, seemingly minor events as catalysts for major narrative shifts, emphasizing Tolkien’s recurring motif of the unassuming altering the course of events.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nThe use of imagery and sound (shadow, fire, horns) not only deepens the scene’s dramatic tension but also enriches its thematic weight. Each symbol contributes layers of meaning, fortifying the passage’s resonance with broader motifs within the tale.\n\nOverall, this excerpt not only ramps up the tension and stakes within the narrative but also encapsulates many enduring themes of Tolkien’s work, blending dramatic action with rich symbolic meaning.

The government measures this by comparing current prices to past prices, a process more complex than it initially appears.\n\n### The Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\nThe most widely used inflation measure is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  The primary CPI (CPI-U) tracks price changes for urban consumers, representing 93% of the U.S. population.  It's an average, not reflecting individual consumer experiences.\n\nThe CPI is calculated monthly using data from 80,000 items in a fixed basket of goods and services representing typical American purchases. This basket includes items ranging from gasoline and groceries to cable TV and healthcare.  The BLS uses the Consumer Expenditures Survey to determine basket contents and item weighting, reflecting the relative importance of each item to the average consumer (e.g., chicken price changes have a greater impact than tofu price changes due to higher consumption).  A version of the CPI (CPI for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) is used to adjust Social Security benefits for inflation.\n\n\n### CPI Price Data Collection\n\nThe BLS collects monthly price data through two surveys: one for most goods and services, and one specifically for housing.\n\nFor most goods and services: BLS representatives (online or in person) or phone calls visit various stores nationwide, recording the prices of the same items each month.  New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago prices are collected monthly, as are nationwide food and energy prices.  Other locations are updated bi-monthly.\n\nFor housing: The BLS collects prices from 50,000 residences via personal visits or calls.  For owner-occupied homes, they use "owners' equivalent rent"—the estimated cost to rent a similar property—as the housing price.  Since rents change infrequently, each unit is sampled every six months, allowing broader housing coverage.\n\n\n### CPI Reporting\n\nThe BLS reports monthly price changes. For example, the CPI might increase by 1.3% from May to June 2022 (seasonally adjusted) but remain unchanged from June to July 2022.  While monthly CPI can be volatile, the trend over several months provides a better indication of inflation.\n\nAnother common report compares the CPI of a given month to the same month a year prior (e.g., July 2022 CPI compared to July 2021 CPI), showing the 12-month price increase.  This approach minimizes the impact of unusually high or low monthly changes.  Both reporting methods are considered accurate.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nConsumer Price Index\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

In Freudian psychology, it refers to the attribution of one's own feelings to another.  In a broader sense, it resembles the flattening of a three-dimensional image onto a two-dimensional surface.  Mathematically, projection is a function transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one (e.g., a cube projected onto a plane).  Crucially, this process is generally irreversible without additional information beyond the projection itself.  Think of Plato's cave allegory: shadows alone don't reveal the objects casting them. Similarly, a child viewing shadow puppets cannot reconstruct the puppets themselves from the shadows alone.\n\nLiterature, however, possesses a unique capacity. The act of writing can be viewed as a "projection downwards," condensing complex emotions into concise metaphors.  Reading, conversely, involves "unprojection"—interpreting these metaphors and reconstructing their multidimensional origins.  This unprojection relies on a shared code between author and reader, a pact whose stability is inherently precarious.  As Paul de Man suggests, reading is writing, and writing is reading, implying a constant, individual negotiation of meaning.\n\n**Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:**\n\nNabokov's predecessors explored the compression of objects into images (projection), and even, as seen in *Jane Eyre*, the process of decompression through unreliable narrators. However, Nabokov uniquely separates consciousnesses in *Pale Fire*, exceeding the capabilities of previous writers.  This is not about interpreting Kinbote's narrative to a higher dimension, but rather analyzing the *interpretive functions* themselves. The novel becomes a study of the interplay between Shade's poem (the projection), and Kinbote's commentary (the attempted unprojection), resulting in a complex interplay of shadows and reflections.  Kinbote's interpretation serves as a "pale, lunar luminescence," illuminating the poem's shadow and transforming it into something new.\n\n\n**Gradus: A Character of Contradictions:**\n\nGradus embodies the novel's central themes. Kinbote relentlessly mocks him, reducing him to a mere reflection of Charles's fantastical journey devoid of humanity. Yet, Gradus's role is far more complex and requires further investigation within the framework of projection and unprojection presented here.  The presentation will continue to explore this character in greater depth, analyzing his contradictory nature within the context of Nabokov's unique literary technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nMathematically, projection is a function transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

In mathematics, a projection is a function or operation that transforms a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one. Imagine a three-dimensional cube being represented on a flat, two-dimensional plane like a piece of paper. This process involves reducing the dimensions of an object while maintaining some aspect of its form.\n\nIn the context of the analysis of Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, this idea of projection is used metaphorically. The complex, multidimensional aspects of a narrative, such as emotions, relationships, or events, are condensed or 'projected' into the written word. Just as a mathematical projection loses some information about the original object, writing distills these complexities into simpler forms like metaphors. However, to understand or 'unproject' these metaphors back to their original richness requires interpretation by readers, relying on shared knowledge and contextual cues.\n\nIn summary, the highlighted text serves as a metaphorical tool to understand how literature can distill complex concepts into more manageable, albeit simplified, forms.	2024-12-18 22:43:01.800307	null	0

For example, American blacks had a life expectancy in 2002 that\nwas 5.4 years less than that of American whites. In England and Wales in 1997–2001,\nmale manual workers could expect to live 8.4 years less than professionals, a gap\nthat has increased since the early 1970s.\nThe decline in mortality over time, differences in mortality across countries\nand differences in mortality across groups within countries are phenomena worthy\nof serious attention by economists and others. We will first lay out the historical\ndecline in mortality, then move to mortality differences between rich and poor\ncountries, and then discuss differences in mortality within countries. A good theory\nof mortality should explain all of the facts we will outline. No such theory exists at\npresent, but at the end of the paper we will sketch a tentative synthesis.\nDeterminants of the Historical Decline in Mortality\nFor most of human history, life was properly described in the famous phrase of\nThomas Hobbes as “nasty, brutish, and short.” From the dawn of Homo sapiens\nperhaps 100,000 years ago until the first agricultural revolution in roughly 10,000\nBCE, world population was about four million people. Life expectancy at birth for\nour hunter-gatherer ancestors was perhaps 25 years. There had been little, if any,\nprogress by the Roman Empire, and even in 1700, life expectancy at birth in\nEngland-after the Netherlands, the richest country in the world at the time—was\nonly 37 years (Wrigley and Schofield, 1981).\nIn the eighteenth century, mortality began to decline. In England and Wales\n(which we refer to as “England” for convenience), the decline started around the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. By 1820, life expectancy at birth in England was\nabout 41 years, up six years over the previous century. Between 1820 and 1870, the\nperiod of greatest industrialization, life expectancy remained stable at about\n41 years. Since 1870, mortality has fallen relatively continuously as well as more\nrapidly than in the first phase of mortality decline. Life expectancy in England\nclimbed to 50 years in the first decade of the twentieth century, and is about 77\nyears today. A similar transition, with some moderate differences in timing, took\nplace in all developed countries. Mortality reduction in France was broadly similar\nto that in England. In the United States, the mortality reduction appears to start\naround 1790, with a similar overall pattern. Life expectancy at birth in the United\nStates rose from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years today.\nThe reduction in mortality was not uniform by age. The vast bulk of the\nhistorical reduction in mortality occurred at younger ages. Figure 2 shows trends in\nlife expectancy by age in England since 1840. Between 1841 and 1950, life expect-\nancy at birth increased by 30 years, while life expectancy at age ten increased by\nonly half that amount. The decline in infectious disease explains this disparate age\npattern. In 1848, 60 percent of deaths in England were from infectious disease.\nBetween then and 1971, infectious disease mortality declined by 95 percent.

A version of the CPI (CPI for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) is used to adjust Social Security benefits for inflation.\n\n\n### CPI Price Data Collection\n\nThe BLS collects monthly price data through two surveys: one for most goods and services, and one specifically for housing.\n\nFor most goods and services: BLS representatives (online or in person) or phone calls visit various stores nationwide, recording the prices of the same items each month.  New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago prices are collected monthly, as are nationwide food and energy prices.  Other locations are updated bi-monthly.\n\nFor housing: The BLS collects prices from 50,000 residences via personal visits or calls.  For owner-occupied homes, they use "owners' equivalent rent"—the estimated cost to rent a similar property—as the housing price.  Since rents change infrequently, each unit is sampled every six months, allowing broader housing coverage.\n\n\n### CPI Reporting\n\nThe BLS reports monthly price changes. For example, the CPI might increase by 1.3% from May to June 2022 (seasonally adjusted) but remain unchanged from June to July 2022.  While monthly CPI can be volatile, the trend over several months provides a better indication of inflation.\n\nAnother common report compares the CPI of a given month to the same month a year prior (e.g., July 2022 CPI compared to July 2021 CPI), showing the 12-month price increase.  This approach minimizes the impact of unusually high or low monthly changes.  Both reporting methods are considered accurate.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nonsumer Price Index (CPI)\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

For example, American blacks had a life expectancy in 2002 that\nwas 5.4 years less than that of American whites. In England and Wales in 1997–2001,\nmale manual workers could expect to live 8.4 years less than professionals, a gap\nthat has increased since the early 1970s.\nThe decline in mortality over time, differences in mortality across countries\nand differences in mortality across groups within countries are phenomena worthy\nof serious attention by economists and others. We will first lay out the historical\ndecline in mortality, then move to mortality differences between rich and poor\ncountries, and then discuss differences in mortality within countries. A good theory\nof mortality should explain all of the facts we will outline. No such theory exists at\npresent, but at the end of the paper we will sketch a tentative synthesis.\nDeterminants of the Historical Decline in Mortality\nFor most of human history, life was properly described in the famous phrase of\nThomas Hobbes as “nasty, brutish, and short.” From the dawn of Homo sapiens\nperhaps 100,000 years ago until the first agricultural revolution in roughly 10,000\nBCE, world population was about four million people. Life expectancy at birth for\nour hunter-gatherer ancestors was perhaps 25 years. There had been little, if any,\nprogress by the Roman Empire, and even in 1700, life expectancy at birth in\nEngland-after the Netherlands, the richest country in the world at the time—was\nonly 37 years (Wrigley and Schofield, 1981).\nIn the eighteenth century, mortality began to decline. In England and Wales\n(which we refer to as “England” for convenience), the decline started around the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. By 1820, life expectancy at birth in England was\nabout 41 years, up six years over the previous century. Between 1820 and 1870, the\nperiod of greatest industrialization, life expectancy remained stable at about\n41 years. Since 1870, mortality has fallen relatively continuously as well as more\nrapidly than in the first phase of mortality decline. Life expectancy in England\nclimbed to 50 years in the first decade of the twentieth century, and is about 77\nyears today. A similar transition, with some moderate differences in timing, took\nplace in all developed countries. Mortality reduction in France was broadly similar\nto that in England. In the United States, the mortality reduction appears to start\naround 1790, with a similar overall pattern. Life expectancy at birth in the United\nStates rose from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years today.\nThe reduction in mortality was not uniform by age. The vast bulk of the\nhistorical reduction in mortality occurred at younger ages. Figure 2 shows trends in\nlife expectancy by age in England since 1840. Between 1841 and 1950, life expect-\nancy at birth increased by 30 years, while life expectancy at age ten increased by\nonly half that amount. The decline in infectious disease explains this disparate age\npattern. In 1848, 60 percent of deaths in England were from infectious disease.\nBetween then and 1971, infectious disease mortality declined by 95 percent.

1c89bf64-3c83-4dd5-8daa-348b7677f2d9	\N	assistant	Certainly! The highlighted portion, "Consumer Price Index (CPI)," is a key concept within this section. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Definition of CPI**: The CPI is an important measure of inflation, which tracks changes in the overall price level of goods and services in the economy. Specifically, the Consumer Price Index measures price changes for urban consumers, covering a broad spectrum of goods and services typical for American consumers.\n\n2. **Purpose and Use**: The CPI is used to gauge inflation by comparing prices over different time periods. It's produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and helps in various applications, such as adjusting Social Security benefits and other financial indices to maintain purchasing power.\n\n3. **Calculation Methodology**: The index is calculated monthly and is based on a "basket" of 80,000 items, including essentials like gasoline, groceries, healthcare, and more. The items are selected and weighted using the Consumer Expenditures Survey to reflect their importance to the average consumer, which means price changes in frequently purchased items have more impact on the CPI.\n\n4. **Data Collection**: The BLS collects price data through surveys, both in person and online, across various locations. This includes residential data for housing through "owners' equivalent rent" and regular updates on food and energy prices.\n\n5. **Reporting**: The BLS reports both monthly and annual changes in the CPI. Monthly reports might show volatility, but the yearly comparison provides a clearer picture of inflation trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations.\n\nOverall, the CPI is a comprehensive tool used to understand and track inflation in the U.S. economy, offering insights into economic health and influencing financial and economic policy decisions.	2024-12-19 00:13:02.797427	null	0

ad2ff6cd-f958-463e-b979-9ac8707ded4e	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nInterest Rates, Bond Yields, and Inflation\n\nOwning a bond is essentially like possessing a stream of future cash payments. Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price – the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk.\n\nBonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts.

ecb18a17-b423-47aa-ac6b-d6d6e280728e	\N	assistant	I'll break down each key takeaway and explain them clearly:\n\n1. "Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa)"\n- This means there's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices\n- When interest rates go up, existing bond prices go down\n- When interest rates go down, existing bond prices go up\n- This happens because newer bonds will be issued at the new interest rate, making existing bonds more or less attractive in comparison\n\n2. "Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy"\n- Central banks (like the Federal Reserve) use interest rates as a tool to control inflation\n- When inflation is high, they raise rates to make borrowing more expensive\n- This "cooling down" helps slow economic activity and reduce inflation\n- We can see this in action in the section where it mentions the Fed raising rates in July 2023\n\n3. "Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts"\n- Inflation decreases the purchasing power of money over time\n- For bonds, this means the fixed payments become worth less in real terms\n- Longer-term bonds are more affected because inflation has more time to erode value\n- This is why investors often demand higher yields for longer-term bonds\n\n4. "Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts"\n- Bond prices react not just to current inflation but also to expectations of future inflation\n- This sensitivity comes from the combined effects of the previous three points\n- Even changes in inflation forecasts can cause bond prices to shift\n- This makes bonds particularly vulnerable to economic news and central bank policies\n\nThese takeaways are interconnected and explain why bonds, interest rates, and inflation are so closely related in financial markets.	2024-12-30 10:02:34.923486	null	0

Let me break down the key elements:\n\n1. Cultural & Family Dynamics:\n- The narrative incorporates Chinese cultural elements (references to Bàba, Māma, Wàipó)\n- There's significance placed on first words in Chinese culture as predictors of future\n- The mother's migration story (Taiwan to US to China) reflects common immigrant experiences\n\n2. Central Characters:\n- The narrator: Unable to speak (aphonia), relies on gestures and expressions\n- Faith: The sister with the musical voice (first word "yīn" meaning sound)\n- Māma: A single mother who eventually must return to China\n- Bàba: Deceased when narrator was three\n\n3. Key Relationships:\n- Particularly powerful is the bond between the siblings - Faith can understand the narrator in an almost supernatural way\n- Complex mother-child dynamics, with the mother seemingly having different visions for each child\n- Absence of the father figure\n\n4. Literary Techniques:\n- The title "Like a Shadow to a Flame" appears symbolic of the narrator's relationship with Faith\n- Beautiful imagery, especially in describing Faith's voice ("smooth like sheets of finely woven silk")\n- Effective use of contrast between sound/silence\n\n5. Emotional Core:\n- Themes of isolation, dependency, and unspoken family dynamics\n- The narrator's struggle with their disability and dependency on others\n- A sense of loss and abandonment when the mother leaves\n\nThe section effectively establishes a melancholic tone while avoiding melodrama, using specific details and cultural elements to create a rich, emotionally resonant narrative foundation.	2024-12-29 13:27:16.390359	null	0
264d1cc6-2d5f-4b56-a3d5-7d29497209c1	\N	assistant	The highlighted portion, "Nazgûl," refers to a group of fictional characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings* series. The Nazgûl, also known as the Ringwraiths or Black Riders, were once kings of Men to whom Sauron, the main antagonist, gave nine Rings of Power. Over time, they became bound to the will of Sauron and transformed into wraith-like beings, losing their physical forms and becoming servants of darkness.\n\nThe Nazgûl are characterized by their haunting presence, invisibility to the human eye except when cloaked, and formidable powers including inducing fear in their opponents. The Lord of the Nazgûl, also called the Witch-king of Angmar, is the leader of the Nazgûl and one of Sauron’s most powerful and trusted followers.\n\nIn this excerpt from *The Return of the King*, the Lord of the Nazgûl plays a central role. His arrival at the gates of Minas Tirith represents a significant threat, symbolizing the might of Sauron's army. However, the confrontation with Gandalf and the subsequent events highlight the theme of hope prevailing over despair, as unexpected elements intervene against the seemingly invincible forces of darkness.	2024-12-19 00:42:06.810081	null	0

This phrase appears at a particularly poignant moment in the text - it's one of the last things the mother says to her son before leaving for China.\n\nThe use of Chinese here is significant for several reasons:\n1. It shows the family's Chinese heritage and linguistic background\n2. It's an intimate, personal moment between mother and son\n3. The timing is meaningful - it's used with a "somber" voice that reminds the narrator of his father's funeral\n4. It's explicitly compared to the tone used at the father's funeral, suggesting something grave or serious is about to be said\n\nThe phrase carries extra emotional weight because it's one of the final direct communications between mother and son before a long separation, and it's delivered in their heritage language rather than English. The text notes that her voice was unusually somber when saying this, suggesting that whatever follows this phrase (which appears to be cut off in this section) is likely to be significant.\n\nGiven that the narrator cannot speak (he has aphonia), this moment of his mother addressing him directly in Chinese feels particularly meaningful.	2024-12-29 13:27:27.678509	null	0

Several elements point to this dark conclusion:\n\n1. Physical elements:\n- The mention of "holding a rope that is a little coarse, but thick enough"\n- The final scene in a dark room with only a fireplace providing light\n\n2. Symbolic elements:\n- The extinguishing of the flame ("I stomp on the flame until it goes out")\n- The elimination of the shadow (representing the self)\n- The philosophical progression: "without light there can be no shadow, without memory there can be no regret, without thought there can be no suffering"\n\n3. Context:\n- This comes after a traumatic event involving Faith (implied sexual assault)\n- The loss of their special communicative bond ("We tried to find it again, but there was nothing to be found")\n- Deep guilt over not protecting his sister ("How could you love someone who let this happen to you")\n\n4. Final imagery:\n- The reference to Cháng'é (the Chinese goddess of the moon)\n- The moon imagery in the final paragraph suggests isolation, silence, and unreachable dreams\n- The description of the moon as "unmoving and without a sound" parallels the narrator's own condition\n\nThe ending is particularly poignant as it contrasts the festive Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations with the narrator's profound isolation and despair, suggesting they see no way forward after the traumatic events that destroyed their special bond with Faith.	2024-12-29 13:27:47.653911	null	3

He then forcefully urges the Nazgûl to return to the abyss prepared for him.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Black Rider throws back his hood, revealing a kingly crown, though no head is visible beneath it. A deadly laughter emanates from the unseen mouth.  The Nazgûl taunts Gandalf, boasting of his victory and challenging him to death. He raises his flaming sword.\n\n**The Unexpected Turning Point:**\n\nAt this crucial moment, a cock crows in a nearby courtyard, a simple, unassuming sound that heralds the approaching dawn. This seemingly insignificant event marks a turning of the tide.\n\n**Rohan's Arrival:**\n\nFollowing the cock's crow, distant horns sound from the slopes of Mount Mindolluin – the arrival of the Rohan army, offering hope and signifying the turning of the tide against the forces of darkness.\n\n\n**Key Elements and Themes:**\n\n* **Good vs. Evil:** The excerpt perfectly illustrates the central conflict of the story, with Gandalf, representing good, standing firm against the overwhelming evil of the Lord of the Nazgûl.\n* **Hope vs. Despair:** The scene balances the immense threat posed by the Nazgûl with the subtle yet powerful symbols of hope: the crowing cock and the sound of Rohan's horns.\n* **Unexpected Intervention:**  The seemingly insignificant act of a cock crowing disrupts the overwhelming power of the Nazgûl and foreshadows the arrival of reinforcements, highlighting the importance of seemingly small events.\n* **Symbolism:**  The use of imagery (shadow, fire, abyss) and sounds (the cock's crow, the horns) is rich in symbolism, contributing to the dramatic tension and thematic depth of the passage.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\napproaching\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

a75b137c-d69e-47c6-b35a-8194b30e3980	\N	assistant	Certainly! Let's break down the highlighted paragraph:\n\n1. **Monthly Calculation of CPI**: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is determined on a monthly basis. This ensures that it captures up-to-date changes in prices across different sectors.\n\n2. **Fixed Basket of Goods and Services**: The CPI uses a "basket" of 80,000 items representing typical purchases made by American consumers. This basket includes a wide range of products and services, such as gasoline, groceries, cable TV, and healthcare. \n\n3. **Consumer Expenditures Survey**: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses this survey to decide what items go into the basket and how much weight each item should have. Weighting reflects the importance or typical spending on each item by an average consumer. For example, if people generally spend more on chicken than on tofu, then changes in chicken prices will have a larger impact on the CPI.\n\n4. **Item Weighting**: The survey helps determine how significant price changes in certain items are for the overall CPI. This is based on how commonly items are consumed. More commonly consumed items will affect the index more.\n\n5. **CPI Variants for Specific Purposes**: There's a specific version of the CPI designed for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. This version is crucial because it's used to adjust Social Security benefits for inflation, ensuring that these benefits maintain their purchasing power over time.\n\nOverall, the paragraph explains how the CPI reflects the relative importance of different consumer goods and services through a complex system involving surveys and weighted calculations. This process ensures that the CPI accurately mirrors the typical consumer's buying habits and responds to price changes accordingly.	2024-12-19 01:57:33.046227	null	0
ab8357bf-7257-4453-8b1a-15d61f88da10	\N	assistant	Certainly! This section explains the concept of inflation and how it's measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Here are the key points:\n\n- **Inflation and CPI**: Inflation is the change in overall price levels of goods and services in the economy over time. The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation and focuses on urban consumers, covering about 93% of the U.S. population.\n\n- **Basket of Goods**: The CPI uses a fixed "basket" of approximately 80,000 items, representing typical American purchases, to track price changes. The basket's composition and the weighting of items are determined by the Consumer Expenditures Survey, which reflects the importance of each item to the average consumer.\n\n- **Data Collection**: Prices are collected monthly through surveys. For most goods, data is gathered from physical stores or online and via phone calls nationwide. Housing prices are collected through visits or calls, using a method called "owners' equivalent rent" for owner-occupied homes.\n\n- **CPI Reporting**: The BLS reports monthly and annual CPI changes. Monthly changes can be volatile, but trends over several months give a clearer picture of inflation. Comparing a month's CPI to the same month in the previous year helps reduce the noise from monthly volatility.\n\nThis section provides a comprehensive overview of how the CPI works as a tool for understanding inflation.	2024-12-19 01:55:59.977955	null	0

Key points:\n- Someone made a claim that something was "impossible"\n- The program "trickster(w)" was designed to return false when w is in language L\n- The text points out that there's actually no contradiction here\n\n3. The core issue:\n- Someone claimed it was impossible for trickster(w) to return false when w ∈ L\n- But that's exactly what trickster was designed to do\n- So saying it's "impossible" is incorrect\n\n4. In simpler terms:\nImagine you have a program designed to say "no" when something is true. Someone claimed this couldn't work, but the text is pointing out that there's nothing stopping a program from being deliberately contrary - it can be programmed to say "no" when the answer is "yes"\n\nThe key takeaway is that the original proof made a logical error by claiming something was impossible when it was actually exactly what the program was designed to do.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this explanation?	2024-12-29 13:50:14.905463	null	1

Here are the key points:\n\n1. Nabokov's claim that "Lolita has no moral in tow" sets up a complicated dynamic with morality throughout the novel.\n\n2. The Foreword of Lolita, written by fictional character John Ray Jr., presents various potential reader reactions, including reasonable concerns about child protection.\n\n3. John Ray Jr.'s moral position is shown to be inadequate and contradictory:\n- He reduces the story to statistics about male behavior\n- He simultaneously condemns Humbert as "abnormal" while praising his artistic expression\n\n4. Rather than simply separating aesthetics from morality, Nabokov creates a complex interrelationship between the two, where they define and redefine each other.\n\n5. This culminates in a key quote from Humbert on page 283, where he grapples with the relationship between his artistic expression and the moral weight of his actions against Dolores Haze.\n\nThe section essentially sets up how Nabokov complicates the traditional separation of moral and aesthetic concerns in literature, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between the two.	2024-12-29 14:02:35.282089	null	0

You’ll submit that separately. Some notation you might want for this problem set:\n\n• The encoding of an object can be denoted ⟨M⟩. • The complement of a language is denoted L<sup>c</sup>. • You can represent different classes of languages as R, RE, co-RE, P, and NP.\n\nProblem One: This Program is Not Responding\n\nThere is no program the OS could run which could determine for sure for all programs if they are causing/will cause an infinite loop, or if they’re just running for a long time. If such a program existed, it would be easy to build a trickster that prevented it. Without such a program, the only way to detect if a program would terminate would be to simulate it, but there’s no way to tell during simulation how long any arbitrary program is going to take unless it halts.\n\nProblem Two: Verifier Warmups i.\n\n- checkSquare1 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate.\n- checkSquare2 is not. It doesn’t take in a certificate.\n- checkSquare3 is not. The program accepts any input n as long as the certificate w equals "n is a perfect square," but a verifier should only accept if n is in the language, and an arbitrary input (like 2) would be accepted but is not in the language.\n- checkSquare4 is - if you squared k, you would see that it either equals or doesn’t equal n, proving if n is a square.\n- checkSquare5 is not, because m and k could be unequal; this only proves that n is a product of two integers.\n- checkSquare6 is, because it halts (guarantees it will take up to k steps) and proves that n is a square.\n- checkSquare7 is not, because it can loop forever.\n\nii.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nclasses\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

Let me help break down the grammar:\n\nThe full phrase is describing a type of consciousness that unifies two fundamental aspects of experience:\n- "I" (the subject/experiencer)\n- "this" (the object/experienced)\n\nGrammatically, "I-this" is functioning as a compound modifier describing the type of consciousness. It's similar to how we might say "red-blue consciousness" if we were describing consciousness of those two colors as unified.\n\nIn philosophical terms, this is describing a state of awareness where:\n1. There's no division between the perceiver ("I")\n2. And what is perceived ("this")\n\nThis becomes clearer when we look at the next line which talks about "the undivided perceiving subject" and "the undivided perceptible object" and "the fusion of the two."\n\nSo while the grammar might seem awkward in English, it's trying to capture a concept where subject and object are experienced as one unified consciousness rather than as separate things.\n\nDoes this help clarify how the grammar is working here?	2024-12-31 19:54:17.303919	null	0

The theory explains how people make decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty, and challenges traditional economic theories about rational decision-making.\n\nKey aspects of Prospect Theory include:\n\n1. People evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point, rather than absolute terms\n2. Losses hurt more than equivalent gains feel good (loss aversion)\n3. People tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight moderate/high probabilities\n4. Decision-makers are generally risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses\n\nFrom the context provided in the excerpt, this work was published five years after their Science article and represented a shift from studying judgment to analyzing decision-making. It became one of the foundational works in behavioral economics.\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular aspect of Prospect Theory in more detail?	2024-12-29 13:48:43.451109	null	12

That is wrong because there’s nothing about  trickster(input)  that influences whether  willAccept(me,input)  would return true. That if and only if only applied in the  ATM  case because membership in the language is decided by what the TM in question returns, but that is not the case for any arbitrary language  L.\n\niii.\n\nThe incorrect claim is that "Given how  trickster  is written, we see that  isValid(me)  returns true if and only if  trickster  is not syntactically valid.

This is actually a common device in Kafka's writing - he often uses protagonists identified only by the initial "K." or "Josef K." (Kafka's first name was Franz Josef).\n\nIn this particular text, there's an interesting contrast where we see a character named "Franz" (Kafka's own first name) as one of K.'s arresters, while the protagonist is referred to simply as "K."\n\nHowever, to properly answer whether this is a usual pattern in Kafka's work, we would need to look at more of his writings beyond this single chunk. What we can say is that the use of "K." as a protagonist identifier is a recognized Kafkaesque technique, creating a sense of anonymity and bureaucratic depersonalization that's characteristic of his work.\n\nThis particular technique also adds to the unsettling and alienating atmosphere of the scene, where K. is being arrested for reasons unknown to him, further emphasizing the theme of individual helplessness against institutional power.	2025-01-03 21:56:18.831389	null	1

But on the concrete road Al built up his speed because the flattened springs were not in danger any more. From Sallisaw to Gore is twenty-one miles and the Hudson was doing thirty-five miles an hour. From Gore to Warner thirteen miles; Warner to Checotah fourteen miles; Checotah a long jump to Henrietta—thirty-four miles, but a real town at the end of it. Henrietta to Castle nineteen miles, and the sun was overhead, and the red fields, heated by the high sun, vibrated the air.\n\nAl, at the wheel, his face purposeful, his whole body listening to the car, his restless eyes jumping from the road to the instrument panel. Al was one with his engine, every nerve listening for weaknesses, for the thumps or squeals, hums and chattering that indicate a change that may cause a breakdown. He had become the soul of the car.\n\nGranma, beside him on the seat, half slept, and whimpered in her sleep, opened her eyes to peer ahead, and then dozed again. And Ma sat beside Granma, one elbow out the window, and the skin reddening under the fierce sun. Ma looked ahead too, but her eyes were flat and did not see the road or the fields, the gas stations, the little eating sheds. She did not glance at them as the Hudson went by.\n\nAl shifted himself on the broken seat and changed his grip on the steering wheel. And he sighed, “Makes a racket, but I think she’s awright. God knows what she’ll do if we got to climb a hill with the load we got. Got any hills ’tween here an’ California, Ma?”\n\nMa turned her head slowly and her eyes came to life. “Seems to me they’s hills,” she said. “’Course I dunno. But seems to me I heard they’s hills an’ even mountains. Big ones.”\n\nGranma drew a long whining sigh in her sleep.\n\nAl said, “We’ll burn right up if we got climbin’ to do. Have to throw out some a’ this stuff. Maybe we shouldn’ a brang that preacher.”\n\n“You’ll be glad a that preacher ’fore we’re through,” said Ma. “That preacher’ll help us.” She looked ahead at the gleaming road again.\n\nAl steered with one hand and put the other on the vibrating gear-shift lever. He had difficulty in speaking. His mouth formed the words silently before he said them aloud. “Ma—” She looked slowly around at him, her head swaying a little with the car’s motion. “Ma, you scared a goin’? You scared a goin’ to a new place?”\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nreal town at the end of it.

The paper specifically uses Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) as their example of rule-based systems.\n\nLet me break this down with a simple example:\n\n1. Elementary Cellular Automata (the example used in the paper):\n- It's a one-dimensional system\n- Each cell can be either black or white (on/off, 1/0)\n- The state of each cell changes based on fixed rules that consider its current state and its neighbors' states\n\nA simpler everyday example would be:\n- A traffic light system\n- Rules: If red → cars stop\n        If green → cars go\n        If yellow → prepare to stop\n- These rules are fixed and determine the system's behavior\n\nThe key characteristics of rule-based systems are:\n1. Clear, definite rules\n2. Predictable outcomes (given the same input)\n3. No learning or adaptation (rules remain constant)\n\nThe paper uses these systems to study how complexity in rules relates to the emergence of intelligent behavior when AI models learn from them.	2024-12-29 14:00:35.655824	null	0

This text (which I believe is from the Kashmir Shaivism tradition) is expressing non-dual Shaivism through this specific formulation of "I-this" consciousness.\n\nThe idea is that:\n- Mahesvara (Shiva) is the ultimate reality\n- This reality manifests as both subjective experience ("I") and objective world ("this")\n- But in truth, these aren't separate - they're undivided in Shiva's consciousness\n- All creatures' true Self is this same Mahesvara/Shiva\n\nSo "I-this consciousness" is a technical term expressing this non-dual view - that subject and object, perceiver and perceived, self and world, are all ultimately unified in Shiva's consciousness. It's different from dualistic views that would see these as fundamentally separate.\n\nThe text is establishing this non-dual principle right at the start as an essential foundation. This makes sense since non-dualism is central to Kashmir Shaivism's understanding of reality.	2024-12-31 19:56:22.723236	null	0

He is one of the most powerful of the Valar, known as a great huntsman and warrior\n2. In Tolkien's legendarium, the Valar were present during the creation and shaping of the world\n3. In the text, Théoden's charge is being compared to Oromë, suggesting a moment of almost divine warrior-like power and glory\n\nThe comparison is particularly apt because:\n- Oromë was known for riding a great horse named Nahar\n- He was associated with hunting and battle\n- The comparison emphasizes how Théoden, in this moment, transcends normal human limitations to become almost godlike in his warrior fury\n\nThis reference helps elevate the scene from a mere cavalry charge to something mythically significant, connecting the present action to the ancient history of Middle-earth.	2025-01-01 05:36:29.054722	null	1

Type of Agreement:\n- If used as a main home and rent is under £100,000 per annum: An Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) is used\n- If NOT used as a main home OR rent is £100,000+ per annum: A Non-Housing Act Tenancy agreement is used\n\n2. Legal Protections:\n- ASTs provide statutory protections under the Housing Act, which typically include:\n  * Regulated deposit protection\n  * Specific notice periods\n  * Statutory rights regarding repairs and maintenance\n\n3. Contractual Requirements:\n- The document specifically requires tenants to warrant (legally declare) that the property will be their main home\n- This suggests the landlord's preference for AST arrangements\n\n4. Potential Risks:\n- Making a false warranty about main home status could potentially:\n  * Breach the tenancy terms\n  * Lead to legal complications\n  * Affect the validity of the agreement\n\nIt's notable that the document emphasizes this point by requiring an explicit warranty from the tenant, indicating its importance in determining the legal framework that will govern the tenancy relationship.	2025-01-03 22:12:41.489864	null	0

This occurs most densely in Lolita’s Foreword, which is a collage of possible readerly postures. Caught in Nabokov’s web, it is easy to forget that many of those postures, such as the desire for social workers and educators to be more vigilant protectors of children, are reasonable and easy to accept. But it is John Ray Jr’s prosaicness, his banal moral position, which dissolves in contact with Lolita. As proof of that moral dissolution, to John, Lolita is a “tempest in a test tube,” a demonstration of an act more than 12% of adult American males “enjoy yearly,” and whose author, had he come in contact with a competent psychopathologist, would have caused no disaster. So we understand early that this John’s position is absurd; we even see it quickly compromised when he suffices to say that Humbert is “abnormal” and “not a gentleman” before praising “how majestically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author.” With this front-loaded guide on how to not read the book—to merely abhor the author while delighting in his gorgeous aesthetics—Nabokov does not simply separate aesthetics from morality, nor does he only problematize aesthetics as something potentially obfuscatory towards proper morals. Instead, he is laying the groundwork for a morality that does not contain aesthetics, but is re and co-defined by its two-way relationship with aesthetics. This we see most clearly stated on page 283 of Lolita, when Humbert says:\n\n“Unless it can be proven to me… that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. To quote an old poet: ‘The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.’”\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\n“Unless it can be proven to me… that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art.

Educational Emphasis:\n- The will specifically mentions both "graduate and undergraduate" education, showing a strong commitment to higher education\n- Education is listed as a primary purpose for the trust, indicating its high priority in the testator's vision for his children's future\n\n2. Financial Security:\n- The provision allows for both "support and education," ensuring basic needs are met alongside educational goals\n- The Trustee is given discretion to use both "net income and principal" to meet these needs, providing flexibility in financial management\n\n3. Prudent Resource Management:\n- The clause includes consideration of "other readily available assets and sources of support," showing a desire for responsible financial stewardship\n- The Trustee's "sole discretion" in determining necessary expenditures adds a layer of professional oversight\n\n4. Long-term Planning:\n- By establishing a trust rather than direct inheritance, the testator ensures controlled distribution of assets for specific purposes\n- This structure provides protection and guidance for the children's financial future in the absence of both parents\n\nThis arrangement demonstrates a careful balance between providing for the children's immediate needs while ensuring their long-term educational and professional development, particularly in the scenario where both parents are deceased.	2025-01-03 21:57:43.705309	null	0

The chunk only provides an overview/table of contents of what will be covered in the full document.\n\nTo properly answer your question about the differences between international and domestic tax incentives and their impacts on film budgets, we would need to examine the sections that specifically discuss these topics. Would you like me to look at other chunks of the document that cover the tax incentive sections in detail?\n\nWhat I can tell from this introductory section is that tax incentives are considered one of the "customary ways" in which motion pictures are financed, alongside other methods like studio financing, pre-sale bank loans, and public/private offerings.	2025-01-05 20:51:58.469521	null	0

First Part:\n"Unless it can be proven to me... that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze has been deprived of her childhood by a maniac"\n- Humbert is acknowledging the harm he's done to Lolita (Dolores Haze)\n- He's saying unless someone can prove that this harm doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things (which he doubts is possible)\n- The parenthetical "(and if it can, then life is a joke)" suggests he believes life would be meaningless if such harm truly didn't matter\n\n2. Second Part:\n"I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art"\n- He sees art (his writing) as his only way to deal with his guilt\n- "Palliative" means something that relieves symptoms without curing the underlying condition\n- He's admitting art can't undo his crimes, only help him cope with his guilt\n\n3. Final Quote:\n"The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty"\n- Suggests that experiencing beauty comes with a moral obligation\n- Like a "duty" or "tax" we must pay\n- Implies that aesthetics (beauty) and morality are interconnected\n\nIn essence, Humbert is wrestling with his guilt while acknowledging that his artistic expression (the novel itself) can't absolve him of his crimes against Lolita.	2024-12-29 14:03:00.054754	null	0

This is his only mention in this particular passage, where he's referenced when Théoden takes a horn from him before blowing a mighty blast that signals the charge of the Rohirrim.\n\nThe role of banner-bearer was an important and honored position in medieval-style warfare, as they carried the symbols of their lord or king into battle. Being close enough to the king to serve as his banner-bearer suggests Guthlaf held a position of trust and significance in Théoden's military hierarchy.\n\nHowever, this is a relatively minor character in the broader scope of The Lord of the Rings, serving primarily in this moment to facilitate one of the most dramatic scenes in the story - when Théoden rallies the Rohirrim for their charge to aid Gondor. The horn he provides becomes an instrument of this pivotal moment, bursting asunder from the force of Théoden's battle cry.	2025-01-01 05:35:49.608879	null	0

4ec0f37c-cee3-4f04-bbc8-6b1479b17254	\N	assistant	I'll break down each key takeaway and explain them clearly:\n\n1. "Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa)"\n- This means there's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices\n- When interest rates go up, existing bond prices go down\n- When interest rates go down, existing bond prices go up\n- This happens because newer bonds will be issued at the new interest rate, making existing bonds more or less attractive in comparison\n\n2. "Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy"\n- Central banks (like the Federal Reserve) use interest rates as a tool to control inflation\n- When inflation is high, they raise rates to make borrowing more expensive\n- This "cooling down" helps reduce spending and slow price increases\n- We can see this in action in the section mentioning the July 2023 FOMC meeting where rates were raised to combat inflation\n\n3. "Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts"\n- Inflation decreases the purchasing power of money over time\n- For bonds, this means the future payments will be worth less in real terms\n- Longer-term bonds are more affected because inflation has more time to erode value\n\n4. "Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts"\n- Bond prices react not just to current inflation\n- They also respond to what investors expect future inflation to be\n- This makes bonds particularly sensitive to economic news and forecasts about inflation\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?	2024-12-30 10:09:01.442799	null	0

All flee except Gandalf, who sits steadfastly on Shadowfax before the Gate.\n\n**Gandalf's Defiance:**\n\nGandalf confronts the Lord of the Nazgûl, forbidding his entry:  "You cannot enter here," he commands, halting the approaching shadow.  He then forcefully urges the Nazgûl to return to the abyss prepared for him.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Black Rider throws back his hood, revealing a kingly crown, though no head is visible beneath it. A deadly laughter emanates from the unseen mouth.  The Nazgûl taunts Gandalf, boasting of his victory and challenging him to death. He raises his flaming sword.\n\n**The Unexpected Turning Point:**\n\nAt this crucial moment, a cock crows in a nearby courtyard, a simple, unassuming sound that heralds the approaching dawn. This seemingly insignificant event marks a turning of the tide.\n\n**Rohan's Arrival:**\n\nFollowing the cock's crow, distant horns sound from the slopes of Mount Mindolluin – the arrival of the Rohan army, offering hope and signifying the turning of the tide against the forces of darkness.\n\n\n**Key Elements and Themes:**\n\n* **Good vs. Evil:** The excerpt perfectly illustrates the central conflict of the story, with Gandalf, representing good, standing firm against the overwhelming evil of the Lord of the Nazgûl.\n* **Hope vs. Despair:** The scene balances the immense threat posed by the Nazgûl with the subtle yet powerful symbols of hope: the crowing cock and the sound of Rohan's horns.\n* **Unexpected Intervention:**  The seemingly insignificant act of a cock crowing disrupts the overwhelming power of the Nazgûl and foreshadows the arrival of reinforcements, highlighting the importance of seemingly small events.\n* **Symbolism:**  The use of imagery (shadow, fire, abyss) and sounds (the cock's crow, the horns) is rich in symbolism, contributing to the dramatic tension and thematic depth of the passage.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nNazgûl\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

Uniform systems:\n- These are systems that produce very simple, unchanging patterns\n- They typically settle into a stable, homogeneous state\n- Example: An ECA rule that turns all cells black or all cells white and stays that way\n\n2. Periodic systems:\n- These systems produce repeating patterns\n- They cycle through a fixed sequence of states in a predictable way\n- Example: An ECA rule that creates a pattern that repeats every few steps\n\nThe key point from the text is that both these types of systems resulted in "poorer downstream performance" when used to train language models. This suggests that systems that are too simple or too predictable don't help develop more intelligent behavior in AI models.\n\nThis observation is particularly important because it contrasts with both:\n- Highly chaotic systems (which also performed poorly)\n- Systems with "higher complexity" (which led to better performance)\n\nThis helps support the paper's main argument about intelligence emerging at the "edge of chaos" - neither too simple (uniform/periodic) nor too chaotic.	2024-12-29 14:03:55.210359	null	0

5cea379e-5109-4586-ab8e-323eabf754cf	\N	assistant	The highlighted text, "Consumer Price Index (CPI)," refers to a crucial economic measure used to track inflation by assessing changes in the price level of goods and services. The CPI is primarily produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and is notably represented through several versions, with CPI-U (for Urban Consumers) being the most widely referenced. It covers approximately 93% of the U.S. population, focusing on urban consumers and utilizes a fixed basket of goods and services that mirror typical American spending. \n\nKey points about the CPI include:\n\n1. **Collection Method**: The CPI is derived from data on 80,000 items collected monthly, which are chosen based on their relevance to typical consumer spending patterns. This data collection process involves surveys in various forms across the country, including in-person visits, phone calls, and online tracking. \n\n2. **Scope**: The CPI's basket includes diverse product categories such as food, fuel, healthcare, and housing, with weighting determined by consumer spending habits to reflect the average impact of price changes in these categories. \n\n3. **Adjustments and Usage**: The CPI is used to adjust Social Security benefits annually to account for inflation, employing a slightly different index called the CPI for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.\n\n4. **Data Reporting**: CPI data is reported monthly, measuring month-to-month changes and comparing prices to the same month in the previous year. This helps identify inflation trends over time despite short-term volatility.\n\nBy understanding the CPI, users can gain insights into inflationary patterns and its impact on consumer purchasing power. The highlighted term stands out as it forms the basis for comprehending inflation through systematic data collection and analysis.	2024-12-19 22:40:49.678672	null	0

Here is an essay based on the content from the document:\n\n---\n\n**Understanding Inflation: The Role of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)**\n\nInflation is a critical economic indicator that reflects the changes in price levels of goods and services across the economy over time. It influences the purchasing power of consumers, the decision-making of policymakers, and the financial planning of businesses. In the United States, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) serves as the most widely recognized measure of inflation, providing insights into how average prices evolve and impacting everything from monetary policy to Social Security adjustments.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and tracks the price changes for urban consumers, which accounts for 93% of the U.S. population. The CPI-U, or CPI for All Urban Consumers, serves as a benchmark for understanding the inflation experienced by the majority of Americans. It is important to note that while the CPI offers a broad perspective on price changes, it is an aggregate measure that doesn't reflect the unique experiences of individual consumers.\n\nAt the heart of the CPI's methodology is a fixed basket of goods and services that represents typical American purchases. This basket includes a wide range of items, from everyday necessities like groceries and gasoline to services such as healthcare and entertainment. The composition and weighting of these items are determined through the Consumer Expenditures Survey, which assesses the relative importance of each item based on average consumption patterns. For instance, changes in chicken prices may have a more significant impact on the CPI than changes in tofu prices due to their higher consumption frequency.\n\nData collection for the CPI is a meticulous process, involving two main surveys. The first collects monthly price data for most goods and services, with BLS representatives visiting stores nationwide either in person, online, or via phone. Major urban centers such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have their prices updated monthly, ensuring timely reflections of cost changes in these economically significant areas. The second survey focuses specifically on housing, utilizing "owners' equivalent rent" to estimate the cost of owner-occupied homes, acknowledging the infrequent nature of rent changes.\n\nReporting the CPI involves analyzing both monthly changes and year-over-year comparisons. Monthly reports can exhibit volatility due to short-term market fluctuations, but a 12-month comparison provides a clearer view of inflation trends by minimizing the impact of anomalously high or low changes. This dual approach aids in understanding the immediate and longer-term inflationary environment, offering valuable information for economic stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the CPI is a fundamental tool in measuring inflation, providing a comprehensive picture of price level changes across urban populations in the United States. Through its rigorous data collection and reporting mechanisms, it not only informs policy decisions but also underpins crucial economic adjustments such as Social Security benefits. Despite its broad scope, users of the CPI must remain cognizant of its aggregate nature, supplementing it with other measures and analyses for more granular insights into the economy. As the economy evolves, the CPI remains a vital measure of the purchasing power and cost of living for American consumers.\n\n--- \n\nThis essay encapsulates the information provided in the document, offering a structured analysis of how inflation is measured through the CPI and its broader implications.	2024-12-19 22:40:15.144201	null	0
ae61ee35-94aa-469e-82e6-72c572a64517	\N	assistant	This document provides an overview of inflation and how it is measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States. It details the methodology employed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to calculate the CPI, focusing on the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which covers 93% of the U.S. population.\n\nKey components of the document include:\n\n1. **Inflation and CPI Overview**: Inflation is the change in the overall price level of goods and services over time. The CPI is the primary measure used to track these changes in prices for urban consumers.\n\n2. **Composition of the CPI**: The CPI is based on a fixed basket of goods and services, including essentials like gasoline, groceries, and healthcare. The BLS determines the content and item weighting of this basket through the Consumer Expenditures Survey.\n\n3. **Data Collection**: The BLS collects price data monthly using surveys. There are two surveys: one for most goods and services and another specifically for housing. Price collection varies by location, with major cities like New York and Los Angeles being updated monthly and other areas bi-monthly. Housing data uses "owners' equivalent rent" to estimate costs for owner-occupied homes.\n\n4. **CPI Reporting**: The CPI is reported both as a monthly change and as a year-over-year comparison. Monthly CPI reports can be volatile, while year-over-year comparisons help smooth out fluctuations and provide a clearer view of inflation trends.\n\nThe document aims to clarify the complexity and methodology behind how inflation is measured through the CPI, emphasizing the broad coverage and systematic approach of the BLS in capturing price changes across the economy.	2024-12-19 22:40:05.090768	null	0
c8a93845-ae23-426a-85d1-e64bf24c96c1	\N	assistant	The highlighted number, 80,000, refers to the items used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) selects a fixed basket of these 80,000 items, representing typical purchases made by American consumers. This basket includes a wide range of goods and services, from everyday items like gasoline and groceries to service-based expenditures like cable TV and healthcare. The diversity and volume of items help ensure that the CPI reflects changes in the cost of living accurately for the average urban consumer in the U.S.\n\nThe 80,000 items are chosen based on data from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, which assesses typical consumer habits and spending. These items are then assigned different weights, reflecting their relative importance or prevalence in the average consumer's spending habits. For example, changes in the price of chicken might have a greater impact on the CPI than changes in the price of tofu, given higher consumption rates of chicken. The comprehensive nature of this item selection is crucial for the CPI's accuracy and reliability as a measure of inflation.	2024-12-19 22:41:01.079355	null	0

The government measures this by comparing current prices to past prices, a process more complex than it initially appears.\n\n### The Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\nThe most widely used inflation measure is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  The primary CPI (CPI-U) tracks price changes for urban consumers, representing 93% of the U.S. population.  It's an average, not reflecting individual consumer experiences.\n\nThe CPI is calculated monthly using data from 80,000 items in a fixed basket of goods and services representing typical American purchases.

New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago prices are collected monthly, as are nationwide food and energy prices.  Other locations are updated bi-monthly.\n\nFor housing: The BLS collects prices from 50,000 residences via personal visits or calls.  For owner-occupied homes, they use "owners' equivalent rent"—the estimated cost to rent a similar property—as the housing price.  Since rents change infrequently, each unit is sampled every six months, allowing broader housing coverage.\n\n\n### CPI Reporting\n\nThe BLS reports monthly price changes. For example, the CPI might increase by 1.3% from May to June 2022 (seasonally adjusted) but remain unchanged from June to July 2022.  While monthly CPI can be volatile, the trend over several months provides a better indication of inflation.\n\nAnother common report compares the CPI of a given month to the same month a year prior (e.g., July 2022 CPI compared to July 2021 CPI), showing the 12-month price increase.

Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price – the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk.\n\nBonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts.

They are nine Men who were given rings of power by Sauron, the Dark Lord. Over time, they fell under his control and became his most feared servants. They are neither living nor dead, existing in a shadowy form bound to their master's will.\n\nIn this specific excerpt, the focus is on the Lord of the Nazgûl, also known as the Witch-king of Angmar. He is the leader of the Nazgûl, possessing significant power and instilling terror. The description of his arrival at Minas Tirith highlights his menacing presence: he is a towering figure that breaches a previously unentered gate, signifying his might and the threat he represents.\n\nThe confrontation with Gandalf illustrates the dichotomy of good versus evil, with Gandalf attempting to thwart the Nazgûl's advance. The Nazgûl's unveiling, with a visible crown but no head, underscores the unnatural aspect of his existence, enhancing the sense of fear he inspires. His deadly laughter and challenge to Gandalf amplify the tension and boost his portrayal as an embodiment of darkness and despair.\n\nOverall, the Nazgûl are crucial in representing the theme of corrupted power and the persistent presence of evil throughout Tolkien's narrative.	2024-12-19 23:22:06.981997	null	0

He then forcefully urges the Nazgûl to return to the abyss prepared for him.\n\n**The Unveiling of the Nazgûl:**\n\nThe Black Rider throws back his hood, revealing a kingly crown, though no head is visible beneath it. A deadly laughter emanates from the unseen mouth.  The Nazgûl taunts Gandalf, boasting of his victory and challenging him to death.

From the excerpt, we can see several key characteristics:\n\n1. Physical Appearance:\n- A towering, menacing figure\n- Wears a hood and crown\n- Notably has no visible head beneath the crown\n- Carries a flaming sword\n\n2. Key Attributes:\n- Extremely powerful and intimidating\n- Commands enough authority to make everyone flee except Gandalf\n- Capable of cruel laughter\n- Associated with shadow and darkness\n- Confident enough to directly challenge Gandalf\n\nIn this specific scene, the Lord of the Nazgûl is presented as a formidable antagonist, powerful enough to breach the previously unbreached gates of Minas Tirith and directly confront one of the story's most powerful good characters, Gandalf.\n\nThe passage portrays the Nazgûl as a representation of overwhelming evil and despair, only countered by unexpected hope (symbolized by the cock's crow and Rohan's horns).	2024-12-24 10:42:07.918694	null	0

Specifically:\n\n1. It shows how aesthetic appreciation (Pnin's perception of the flowers) emerges directly from a moment of trauma and restriction, much like how Humbert's "articulate art" emerges from his moral crimes.\n\n2. The writer appears to be building a case that Nabokov's works consistently show aesthetics not as separate from moral/psychological concerns, but as fundamentally linked to them. This challenges simplistic readings that would separate artistic beauty from moral content.\n\n3. The analysis resists both pure aesthetic readings (art for art's sake) and purely moral/psychological readings (like the psychoanalytic interpretation the narrator mocks). Instead, it suggests these elements are inseparable and mutually defining.\n\n4. This moment in Pnin serves as a parallel to the Lolita discussion, suggesting that across Nabokov's work, there's a consistent exploration of how beauty and suffering, aesthetics and trauma, are interconnected.\n\nThe writer seems to be using this scene to build a larger argument about how Nabokov's work consistently shows aesthetics as emerging from and being shaped by moral and psychological trauma, rather than existing in isolation from it.	2024-12-29 14:04:56.499748	null	1

In Freudian psychology, it refers to the attribution of one's own feelings to another.  In a broader sense, it resembles the flattening of a three-dimensional image onto a two-dimensional surface.  Mathematically, projection is a function transforming a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one (e.g., a cube projected onto a plane).  Crucially, this process is generally irreversible without additional information beyond the projection itself.  Think of Plato's cave allegory: shadows alone don't reveal the objects casting them. Similarly, a child viewing shadow puppets cannot reconstruct the puppets themselves from the shadows alone.\n\nLiterature, however, possesses a unique capacity. The act of writing can be viewed as a "projection downwards," condensing complex emotions into concise metaphors.  Reading, conversely, involves "unprojection"—interpreting these metaphors and reconstructing their multidimensional origins.  This unprojection relies on a shared code between author and reader, a pact whose stability is inherently precarious.  As Paul de Man suggests, reading is writing, and writing is reading, implying a constant, individual negotiation of meaning.\n\n**Nabokov's Innovation in *Pale Fire*:**\n\nNabokov's predecessors explored the compression of objects into images (projection), and even, as seen in *Jane Eyre*, the process of decompression through unreliable narrators. However, Nabokov uniquely separates consciousnesses in *Pale Fire*, exceeding the capabilities of previous writers.  This is not about interpreting Kinbote's narrative to a higher dimension, but rather analyzing the *interpretive functions* themselves. The novel becomes a study of the interplay between Shade's poem (the projection), and Kinbote's commentary (the attempted unprojection), resulting in a complex interplay of shadows and reflections.  Kinbote's interpretation serves as a "pale, lunar luminescence," illuminating the poem's shadow and transforming it into something new.\n\n\n**Gradus: A Character of Contradictions:**\n\nGradus embodies the novel's central themes. Kinbote relentlessly mocks him, reducing him to a mere reflection of Charles's fantastical journey devoid of humanity. Yet, Gradus's role is far more complex and requires further investigation within the framework of projection and unprojection presented here.  The presentation will continue to explore this character in greater depth, analyzing his contradictory nature within the context of Nabokov's unique literary technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nUnprojection\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

If you're referring to the concept of "unprojection" and how it flows or unfolds in the text, I can certainly elaborate on that. "Unprojection" in this context refers to the process of reading and interpreting literature, where the reader works to reconstruct the complex emotions or ideas condensed into the author's metaphors. It's about extracting the multidimensional origins of these metaphors during the reading process.\n\nWould you like more detail on how "unprojection" operates within this analysis of *Pale Fire*?	2024-12-20 03:14:52.123367	null	0

Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

37844994-db44-4f1d-be9f-4aedd26d9e4d	\N	assistant	This opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence is essentially setting up the entire document's purpose. Let me break it down into simpler terms:\n\nKey components:\n\n1. "When in the course of human events" - This indicates that there are times in history when certain actions become necessary\n\n2. "dissolve the political bands" - Breaking political ties (specifically with Great Britain)\n\n3. "assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station" - Taking their place as an independent nation, equal to other nations\n\n4. "laws of nature and nature's God entitle them" - Claiming their right to independence based on both natural law and divine right\n\n5. "decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires" - Acknowledging their obligation to explain their actions to the world\n\nIn modern terms, this paragraph is saying:\n\n"When it becomes necessary for one group of people to break away from another country and become an independent nation (which they have a right to do according to both natural and divine law), they should explain their reasons for doing so to the rest of the world."\n\nIt's essentially a sophisticated way of saying "We're breaking up with Britain, and here's why..." The paragraph serves as a formal introduction to justify the colonies' decision to declare independence, acknowledging that such a serious step requires proper explanation.	2024-12-30 10:14:32.183942	null	0

70730a23-e11b-47af-98ef-890bac9530a1	\N	assistant	I'll provide a comprehensive analysis of this pivotal excerpt from The Return of the King:\n\n1. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe scene is masterfully constructed in rising dramatic tension, following a classic five-part structure:\n- Establishment (The Nazgûl's arrival)\n- Confrontation (Gandalf's stand)\n- Climax build-up (The Nazgûl's unveiling)\n- Climactic moment (The raised flaming sword)\n- Resolution/turning point (Cock crow and Rohan's horns)\n\n2. SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS\n\nA. Light vs. Darkness Imagery:\n- The Nazgûl represents ultimate darkness ("approaching shadow")\n- Gandalf, often associated with light, stands as a beacon\n- The dawn's approach symbolizes hope breaking through darkness\n- The flaming sword creates an ironic contrast - evil wielding fire, typically associated with light\n\nB. Sound Symbolism:\n- The progression from silence to sound is significant:\n  * The deadly quiet of the Nazgûl's approach\n  * The hollow laughter from the unseen mouth\n  * The humble cock crow\n  * The triumphant horns of Rohan\nEach sound carries specific symbolic weight and emotional resonance.\n\n3. LITERARY DEVICES\n\nA. Contrasts:\n- Power vs. Humility (mighty Nazgûl vs. simple rooster)\n- Supernatural vs. Natural (magical confrontation vs. natural dawn)\n- Complexity vs. Simplicity (epic standoff vs. basic farmyard sound)\n\nB. Dramatic Irony:\n- The Nazgûl's moment of seeming triumph is immediately undercut\n- The reader understands the significance of the cock crow before the characters do\n\n4. THEMATIC ANALYSIS\n\nA. Power of Hope:\n- The scene demonstrates how hope can persist in the darkest moments\n- Small, ordinary things can have tremendous impact\n- Victory often comes from unexpected sources\n\nB. Nature vs. Evil:\n- Natural elements (dawn, rooster) triumph over supernatural evil\n- Suggests nature itself opposes the forces of darkness\n- Echoes Tolkien's environmental themes\n\nC. Courage and Resistance:\n- Gandalf's solitary stand represents moral courage\n- Physical resistance against overwhelming odds\n- The power of individual action in the face of evil\n\n5. CHARACTER INSIGHTS\n\nA. Gandalf:\n- Demonstrates both wisdom and warrior courage\n- Shows leadership through example\n- Represents the last line of defense for civilization\n\nB. The Lord of the Nazgûl:\n- Embodies corrupted power\n- The empty crown symbolizes hollow authority\n- Represents pride before the fall\n\n6. HISTORICAL AND MYTHOLOGICAL CONNECTIONS\n\nA. Medieval Influences:\n- The gate siege recalls medieval warfare\n- The champion's confrontation echoes epic poetry\n- Religious symbolism of light vs. darkness\n\nB. Folk Traditions:\n- The cock crow dispersing evil spirits is a common folklore element\n- Dawn as a time of evil's retreat appears in many cultures\n\n7. NARRATIVE SIGNIFICANCE\n\nA. Plot Function:\n- Creates maximum tension before relief\n- Establishes the stakes of the battle\n- Sets up the eventual defeat of the Nazgûl\n\nB. Pacing:\n- Slow build of tension\n- Swift transition to hope\n- Masterful timing of relief\n\n8. CONTEXTUAL IMPORTANCE\n\nA. Within the Larger Story:\n- Represents a crucial turning point in the siege\n- Demonstrates the pattern of hope appearing in darkness\n- Connects to other major themes in the trilogy\n\nB. Character Development:\n- Shows Gandalf at his most commanding\n- Reveals the limitations of the Nazgûl's power\n- Sets up later events and victories\n\n9. WRITING TECHNIQUE\n\nA. Sensory Details:\n- Visual (crown, hood, sword)\n- Auditory (laughter, crow, horns)\n- Atmospheric (shadow, dawn)\n\nB. Perspective:\n- Balanced between immediate action and broader significance\n- Maintains tension while suggesting hope\n\n10. PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nA. Nature of Evil:\n- Evil's power is ultimately hollow (crowned but headless)\n- Pride precedes defeat\n- Evil contains seeds of its own destruction\n\nB. Role of Providence:\n- Timing of natural events suggests divine intervention\n- Small actions have great consequences\n- Hope arrives at the darkest moment\n\nThis scene exemplifies Tolkien's mastery of multiple literary elements working in harmony to create a moment of both high drama and deep meaning. It demonstrates his ability to weave together action, symbolism, and theme while maintaining narrative momentum and emotional impact. The scene serves as a microcosm of the larger story's themes and demonstrates the author's sophisticated understanding of how to create and resolve tension in meaningful ways.	2024-12-24 14:54:10.23115	null	0

abcbcfd1-05db-4069-a764-cf63510d98b8	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nThe Ride of the Rohirrim\n\nNow silently, the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of Gondor, pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure. The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.

ARTICLE I - DEBTS AND EXPENSES \n\n1.1 Debts and Expenses. I direct my Executor to pay my funeral expenses, my medical expenses,  the costs of administration, including ancillary, and such of my enforceable debts, other than those  secured by property specifically devised under this Will or secured by property passing outside of  this Will as my Executor, with sole discretion, determines shall be paid. \n\nARTICLE II - SPECIFIC GIFTS \n\n2.1 Personal Effects.

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.

From that section, we know that:\n\n1. Primary Protection Mechanisms of SPVs:\n- They insulate assets of the producer, parent company, and financiers from liability\n- They create a clean slate entity with no previous liabilities, which insurance companies prefer\n- They serve as the contracting entity for all key agreements (cast, director, crew, investors, guilds, and distributors)\n\nHowever, to fully address the potential legal or financial challenges that might arise when using SPV structures, we would need to examine other sections of the document that may discuss these aspects in more detail.\n\nWhat we can infer from the context is that SPVs are particularly important in film financing because:\n1. The document notes that "most films are not financially successful endeavors"\n2. There is "significant financial risk with any production"\n3. Multiple parties are involved in contracts (as listed above)\n\nTo provide a complete answer about potential challenges with SPV structures, we would need to see additional sections of the document that might address liability issues, contractual obligations, or financial structuring in more detail. Would you like me to look at other chunks that might contain this information?	2025-01-05 21:04:11.139887	null	1

While the document mentions international markets and territory buyers, it doesn't specifically address Canadian investment opportunities or regulations.\n\nTo properly answer questions about investing in Canadian film projects, we would need to:\n1. Look for sections discussing international tax incentives (which was mentioned in the table of contents)\n2. Find any specific references to Canadian regulations or market conditions\n3. Review sections about international private placements or cross-border investments\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Look for other chunks that might contain information about Canadian film investment specifically?\n2. Or explore the general international investment principles that might apply to Canadian investments?\n\nFrom what we've seen so far, any investment would likely still involve the basic structures mentioned (SPVs, completion bonds, etc.), but there may be specific Canadian regulations and incentives that would be important to understand.	2025-01-05 22:16:23.903633	null	2

Behind him, his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nOromë the Great\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

959cad2b-964b-4508-8e70-908b61ab96dc	\N	assistant	This moment is designed to evoke intense emotions of courage, inspiration, and dramatic triumph over despair. Let me break down how the text builds to this feeling:\n\n1. Earlier Mood:\n- The passage begins with dread and hesitation\n- Théoden appears old and cowed\n- There's a "weight of horror and doubt"\n- Everything seems "too late"\n\n2. The Transformation:\n- A sudden change occurs with wind and light\n- Théoden transforms from "bent shape" to "tall and proud"\n- His voice becomes supernaturally powerful ("more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve")\n\n3. The Highlighted Battle Cry:\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n- The repetition of "ride now" creates urgency\n- The exclamation marks convey passion and energy\n- The simplicity makes it powerfully memorable\n- It's repeated twice for maximum impact\n\nWe're meant to feel:\n- Exhilaration\n- Relief (from the previous despair)\n- Inspirational surge\n- Martial pride\n- A sense of historic moment\n\nThe passage deliberately builds from darkness to light, from doubt to certainty, making this battle cry feel like an emotional release and a call to greatness.	2025-01-01 05:36:09.456824	null	0
dc26bb3a-d3c0-4b37-840d-20899759d1d6	\N	assistant	Théoden's hesitation to give a signal can be understood through several contextual clues in the passage:\n\n1. Psychological State:\n- The passage describes him as appearing "cowed by age"\n- He seems "stricken suddenly by anguish or dread"\n- He's witnessing the "agony of Minas Tirith"\n\n2. Tactical Considerations:\n- They're moving "silently" and "unchallenged"\n- The element of surprise is working in their favor\n- The Black Captain remains unaware of their presence\n\n3. Strategic Timing:\n- The text suggests they're waiting for the right moment\n- They're positioning themselves "between the fires of the siege and the outer fields"\n- The timing needs to be perfect for maximum impact\n\n4. Internal Conflict:\n- There's a suggestion of doubt and hesitation\n- Merry observes that Théoden might "quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away"\n- The weight of the moment and responsibility seems to temporarily paralyze him\n\nThe lack of signal represents a crucial moment of tension before the dramatic transformation that follows when the wind changes and Théoden bursts into his rallying cry.

b05c7732-2456-42e0-858d-814a41241285	\N	assistant	In Tolkien's mythology, Oromë is one of the Valar - powerful divine beings who helped shape the world. He is specifically known as the "Great Rider" or "Huntsman of the Valar," and is associated with hunting, horses, and the wilderness.\n\nThe "battle of the Valar" likely refers to the War of Wrath, which was the great war at the end of the First Age where the Valar fought against Morgoth (the first Dark Lord and Sauron's master). This was the greatest battle in Middle-earth's history.\n\nThe comparison in this passage is particularly significant because:\n\n1. Like Oromë, Théoden is portrayed as a great horseman leading a charge\n2. The comparison elevates Théoden's charge to a mythological level, suggesting his actions are as epic as those of the gods themselves\n3. It connects the present battle (against Sauron's forces) to the ancient battles of the First Age, suggesting a continuation of the same struggle against evil\n\nThe simile "like a god of old" followed by the specific reference to Oromë is meant to show Théoden at his most magnificent, transformed from an aged king to a figure of legend, riding with divine-like power against the forces of darkness.\n\nThis reference is particularly apt because Oromë was known for inspiring courage in others and fighting against darkness, which is exactly what Théoden is doing in this moment of the battle.	2025-01-01 05:46:16.472174	null	1

192ee963-4128-4284-aea0-a98e4185a718	\N	assistant	Snowmane is King Théoden's horse. In this section, we see the beginning of a dramatic charge into battle, with Théoden calling to his mount Snowmane who responds immediately by springing into action.\n\nIn Tolkien's works, horses - especially those belonging to the Rohirrim (the horse-lords) - are often named and are important characters in their own right. The Rohirrim are known for their deep connection with horses, and Snowmane, as the king's steed, would be among the finest of their horses.\n\nThis is actually a significant moment in the story, as it marks the beginning of a heroic charge. The rest of the passage describes how Théoden leads this charge, outpacing even his own banner and knights, with Snowmane carrying him forward like one of the ancient gods.\n\nThe name "Snowmane" itself suggests the horse's appearance - likely white or light in color - and reflects the Rohirrim tradition of giving their horses meaningful names.	2025-01-01 05:45:55.957619	null	1

a48fa92a-4de7-4574-ba2c-169ff269b354	\N	assistant	The City being referred to is Minas Tirith, the capital city of Gondor. This is made clear earlier in the passage where it's explicitly named ("the agony of Minas Tirith"). The scene describes the Rohirrim approaching Minas Tirith while it's under siege by Sauron's forces, led by the Black Captain (the Witch-king of Angmar).\n\nThe highlighted phrase "earth beneath the City" is part of a description of a dramatic moment where lightning appears to spring from the ground under Minas Tirith, followed by a great boom. This is likely describing either part of the enemy's assault on the city or a consequence of the siege warfare taking place.\n\nThe capital "C" in "City" is also notable, suggesting the author is treating Minas Tirith with a special significance, as the great city of the realm of Gondor.	2025-01-01 05:52:48.418205	null	0
c679034e-aa01-44aa-a9e4-8eceedd2d247	\N	assistant	The delay in Théoden giving the signal reflects several important psychological and tactical elements in this passage:\n\n1. Strategic Timing:\n- The Rohirrim are positioning themselves carefully ("led his men away somewhat eastward")\n- They need the perfect moment to strike between the siege fires and outer fields\n\n2. Psychological State:\n- The text shows Théoden becoming overwhelmed by what he sees ("as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread")\n- He appears temporarily paralyzed by the horror of seeing Minas Tirith under siege\n- There's a suggestion of self-doubt and age weighing on him ("seemed to shrink down, cowed by age")\n\n3. Building Tension:\n- The lack of signal creates dramatic tension in the narrative\n- It reflects the weight of the moment and the massive responsibility on Théoden's shoulders\n- Even Merry feels this tension ("His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty")\n\n4. Transformation Point:\n- This hesitation actually sets up the dramatic contrast for when Théoden does finally break free of his doubt\n- The delay makes his eventual rally cry ("Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!") even more powerful\n\nThe lack of signal represents both tactical patience and a moment of human vulnerability before a crucial battle, making Théoden's subsequent transformation into a confident leader more impactful.	2025-01-01 05:53:01.7058	null	0
d460e53f-ca5c-4d94-a23e-cdfc9526daed	\N	assistant	The mood is grim for several key reasons in this passage:\n\n1. Imminent Defeat: There's a strong sense that they may be "too late" to save Minas Tirith. This is directly stated in the text: "Too late was worse than never!"\n\n2. Environmental Details: The passage creates a dark atmosphere through sensory details:\n- "A smell of burning was in the air"\n- There's "a very shadow of death"\n- The horses are described as "uneasy"\n\n3. Théoden's Demeanor: The king himself appears defeated before the battle even begins:\n- He's described as "stricken suddenly by anguish or dread"\n- He seems to "shrink down, cowed by age"\n- There's fear that he might "quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills"\n\n4. Merry's Internal State: The passage shows the grimness through Merry's perspective:\n- "a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him"\n- "His heart beat slowly"\n- "Time seemed poised in uncertainty"\n\n5. The Enemy's Strength: The text opens by noting that the Black Captain is fully focused on destroying the city, and nothing has warned him of any threat, suggesting the overwhelming nature of the evil forces.\n\nThis creates a moment of maximum tension and despair before the dramatic turnaround that comes with the dawn and Théoden's rallying cry.	2025-01-01 05:53:15.024662	null	0

6ec88a36-dd28-4d59-981a-97f03b6faa2c	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nThe Ride of the Rohirrim\n\nNow silently, the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of Gondor, pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure. The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nBut at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City.

b0bed146-5add-471e-9ca6-b4c15dd35be1	\N	assistant	The "representative houses" being referred to are colonial legislatures - the elected legislative bodies that governed individual colonies before American independence. These were similar to today's state legislatures and were the primary form of local democratic representation in colonial America.\n\nThese colonial assemblies were particularly important because they:\n1. Represented the colonists' interests directly to colonial governments\n2. Had the power to pass local laws\n3. Controlled colonial budgets and spending\n4. Served as a check on the power of royal governors\n\nWhen the text says these houses were "dissolved," it means King George III forcibly shut them down and dismissed their members, particularly when they opposed his policies. A notable example was the dissolution of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1774 by Royal Governor Lord Dunmore after it expressed support for Boston following the Boston Tea Party.\n\nThe phrase "repeatedly" indicates this wasn't an isolated incident - it was a pattern of the king dissolving colonial legislatures whenever they stood up against what the colonists viewed as unjust policies or "invasions on the rights of the people."	2025-01-01 05:55:31.630728	null	1

Clear Interface Separation:\n- The document explicitly states that "adapters.py should not contain any substantive logic"\n- It serves purely as a connection layer that invokes the actual implementations\n- This creates a clear boundary between interface definition and implementation details\n\n2. Implementation Freedom:\n- The document mentions "cs336_basics/*: This is where you write your code.. Note that there's no code in here! So you can do whatever you want from scratch!"\n- This separation allows developers complete freedom in how they implement the core functionality, as long as it can be properly connected through the adapter\n\n3. Testing Architecture:\n- The document describes "test_*.py" that contains tests which "invoke the hooks defined in adapters.py"\n- This creates a three-layer architecture:\n  * Implementation layer (cs336_basics/*)\n  * Adapter layer (adapters.py)\n  * Testing layer (test_*.py)\n\n4. Standardization:\n- By requiring specific functionality (like scaled dot product attention) to be exposed through standardized adapter methods, it ensures consistent interfaces regardless of implementation details\n\nThis design pattern promotes:\n- Modularity\n- Testability\n- Implementation flexibility\n- Clear separation between interface contracts and implementation details\n\nThis is particularly relevant for complex operations like scaled dot product attention, where the implementation details might vary but need to conform to a standard interface for testing and integration purposes.	2025-01-03 11:57:38.79736	null	0

f294fffa-8917-4423-90aa-893ff8184270	\N	assistant	Based on the text, I can explain the relationship between Fed rate hikes and bond pricing, though the text doesn't fully detail the specific differences between long-term and short-term impacts. Here's what we can determine:\n\nDirect Impacts:\n1. When the Fed raises rates (as mentioned in the July 2023 FOMC meeting raising to 5.25%-5.50%), bond prices generally fall. This is explicitly mentioned as "interest rate risk" in the text - "Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices."\n\n2. The text mentions that "changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways," though it doesn't elaborate on the specific differences in this chunk.\n\nKey Mechanisms:\n1. Value Relationship: The text explains that a bond's value is "a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations."\n\n2. Fed's Motivation: The text indicates that the Fed raises rates specifically to "cool down an overheating economy" when inflation rises.\n\n3. Current Context: The text notes that as of the time of writing, "the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%" and the Fed "expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation."\n\nIt's worth noting that while the text introduces the concept that different term bonds are affected differently by rate changes, it doesn't provide the specific details of these differences. To provide a more complete answer about the varying impacts on long-term versus short-term bonds, we would need additional information not present in this text chunk.	2025-01-04 00:01:26.735227	null	0

1346ba81-04f2-4f95-9db7-8997490233e8	\N	assistant	Let me provide a comprehensive analysis of "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening":\n\nThe poem unfolds in four carefully crafted stanzas, each painting a specific aspect of the scene and the speaker's experience:\n\n1. First Stanza:\n- Introduces the setting and establishes ownership of the woods\n- Shows the speaker's familiarity with the area ("I think I know")\n- Creates a sense of mild transgression as the speaker stops on someone else's property\n\n2. Second Stanza:\n- Shifts perspective to include the horse's reaction\n- Emphasizes the isolation ("without a farmhouse near")\n- Sets the specific time and conditions ("darkest evening of the year")\n- Places us between "woods and frozen lake"\n\n3. Third Stanza:\n- Introduces sound through the horse's bells\n- Creates a beautiful auditory image with "sweep of easy wind and downy flake"\n- Emphasizes the deep silence by noting these are the only sounds\n\n4. Final Stanza:\n- Moves from observation to reflection\n- Features the famous repeated line "And miles to go before I sleep"\n- Contrasts the tempting beauty of nature ("lovely, dark and deep") with duty ("promises to keep")\n\nThe poem masterfully employs several poetic devices:\n- Consistent rhyme scheme (AABA BBCB CCDC DDDD)\n- Rich imagery combining visual and auditory elements\n- Symbolism suggesting deeper themes of duty versus desire, mortality, and the pull of nature\n\nThis creates a piece that works both as a simple nature observation and as a deeper meditation on life's obligations and temptations.	2025-01-01 10:56:41.620877	null	0
1f98dd10-2065-44ec-a0f4-4652614bcdfb	\N	assistant	The poem explores:\n1. Loneliness and isolation\n2. The tension between duty ("promises to keep") and desire (to stay in the peaceful woods)\n3. Weariness/exhaustion (suggested by the repeated "miles to go before I sleep")\n4. A possible contemplation of mortality (the dark, snowy woods symbolizing death's allure)\n\nThese emotions are subtly woven into what seems like a simple scene of someone stopping in the woods.	2025-01-01 10:57:02.745045	null	0

Here are the key points:\n\n1. Direct Quote Context:\nNabokov explicitly states that "even with the best of vision one must touch things to be quite sure of 'reality'" (141). This suggests that:\n- Visual perception alone is insufficient for understanding reality\n- Physical/tactile experience is necessary for complete understanding\n- There's an inherent limitation to purely optical observation\n\n2. Photographic Theme:\nThe text indicates that while photography is a prevalent theme in Nabokov's work, it's presented as potentially problematic because:\n- Like an "overexposed image," it can lose sharpness due to overuse\n- It represents only one dimension of experiencing reality\n- It needs to be "stacked level upon level" to create a "final picture"\n\n3. Implications for Lolita:\nThis distinction suggests that:\n- The narrator's (Humbert's) visual obsession might represent an incomplete or unreliable perception of reality\n- Multiple layers of perception are needed for understanding the true nature of events\n- There's a gap between what is seen and what is real\n\nThe text suggests that understanding Lolita requires looking beyond the surface-level visual elements to grasp the fuller reality of the narrative, much like Nabokov's insistence on touching to verify reality rather than relying solely on vision.	2025-01-03 12:04:08.606977	null	0

Type of Agreement:\n- If the property is used as a main home and the rent is less than £100,000 per year, an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) will be used\n- If the property is not used as a main home, a Non-Housing Act Tenancy agreement will be used, regardless of the rent amount\n\n2. Legal Warranty:\n- The document explicitly requires tenants to warrant (legally declare) that the property will be their main home\n- By signing the Confirmation of Offer, tenants are making this legal commitment\n\n3. Potential Legal Implications:\n- Making a false warranty about main home status could constitute "false or misleading information" which is specifically mentioned as grounds for losing the holding deposit\n- This suggests serious consequences for misrepresenting the intended use of the property\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the chunk doesn't detail the specific differences between AST and Non-Housing Act Tenancies in terms of tenant rights and protections. To provide a complete answer about the full implications, we would need additional documentation covering the specific terms of both types of agreements.\n\nKey Consideration:\nThe explicit requirement to warrant main home status suggests this is a material term of the agreement, and misrepresentation could have significant legal and financial consequences.	2025-01-03 22:12:49.699401	null	0

cb6ea616-93fe-4d48-808c-9fb17a39825c	\N	assistant	The Declaration of Independence strongly reflects Enlightenment ideas in several key ways:\n\n1. Natural Rights Philosophy:\n- The document explicitly references "the laws of nature and nature's God," reflecting Enlightenment concepts of natural law\n- States that "all men are created equal" and possess "unalienable rights" including "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" - echoing John Locke's ideas about natural rights\n- These rights are presented as "self-evident truths," emphasizing reason and rationality, key Enlightenment values\n\n2. Social Contract Theory:\n- States that governments "derive their just powers from the consent of the governed"\n- Explains that governments are "instituted among men" to "secure these rights"\n- When government fails this purpose, people have the right to "alter or abolish it"\n- This directly reflects Enlightenment philosophers like Locke and Rousseau's ideas about the social contract\n\n3. Rational Justification:\n- The document states that "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes"\n- Promises to "submit facts to a candid world"\n- This reflects the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, evidence, and public discourse\n\n4. Popular Sovereignty:\n- Emphasizes the right of "the people" to establish new government\n- Government power comes from below (the people) rather than above (divine right)\n- This reflects the Enlightenment rejection of absolute monarchy\n\nThe influence on seeking independence is clear in the text:\n- The colonists justify revolution based on rational principles rather than mere grievances\n- They present their case as a logical conclusion based on universal principles\n- The document frames independence as a natural right when government becomes "destructive of these ends"\n- It establishes that revolution is not just a right but a "duty" when faced with "absolute despotism"\n\nThe text shows how Enlightenment principles provided both the philosophical justification for independence and the intellectual framework for establishing a new form of government.	2025-01-03 12:03:57.815758	null	0

Clean Slate: By revoking all previous codicils and wills, the testator (Venkat Vajipey) ensures there are no conflicting or outdated modifications to his estate plan. A codicil is an amendment or supplement to a will that modifies, explains, adds to, or subtracts from the will's provisions.\n\n2. Legal Clarity: This revocation helps prevent potential confusion or legal disputes after death by:\n- Eliminating any ambiguity about which documents are valid\n- Preventing the possibility of multiple, potentially conflicting instructions\n- Ensuring all estate planning wishes are contained in one current document\n\n3. Administrative Efficiency: For the executor and probate court, having a single, comprehensive document (rather than a will plus various codicils) makes the probate process more straightforward and efficient.\n\n4. Risk Mitigation: Old codicils might contain outdated information or wishes that no longer reflect the testator's current intentions. Revoking them prevents these outdated modifications from accidentally remaining in effect.\n\nThe phrase "hereby revoking all wills and codicils heretofore made by me" is standard legal language that creates a clean break from all previous estate planning documents, ensuring this new will stands as the sole expression of the testator's wishes.	2025-01-03 22:06:33.090291	null	0

cbce39f1-c845-4166-a45b-d3576b985cb1	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nInterest Rates, Bond Yields, and Inflation\n\nOwning a bond is essentially like possessing a stream of future cash payments. Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price – the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk.\n\nBonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nbreaks\n\nYour role is to:\n1. Help users understand this section in detail\n2.

a256851c-7fad-42e4-9c92-503dab8998c4	\N	assistant	From this chunk of text alone, the specific calculation method for determining the probability of a negative credit event is not explicitly detailed. While the text mentions credit risk and acknowledges that it affects bond prices, it doesn't break down the variables or methodology used to calculate this probability.\n\nWhat we can learn from this text is that:\n1. Credit risk is one of two primary risks in bond investing (alongside interest rate risk)\n2. Credit risk is defined as "the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments"\n3. There's a direct relationship between credit risk and interest rates: higher risk = higher interest rates demanded by investors\n\nTo provide a complete and accurate answer about how credit event probabilities are calculated, we would need additional information beyond what's contained in this text chunk. This would likely involve looking at:\n- Credit rating methodologies\n- Historical default data\n- Financial metrics of the issuer\n- Economic conditions\n- Industry-specific factors\n\nWould you like me to look for other chunks that might contain more specific information about credit risk calculation methods?	2025-01-03 04:13:05.047803	null	0

7abf77d4-6996-4482-9915-ba9202275b71	\N	assistant	In this poem, the word "queer" is used in its older sense, meaning strange, odd, or unusual - not in its modern usage. When Frost writes "My little horse must think it queer/To stop without a farmhouse near," he's suggesting that the horse finds it strange or peculiar that they're stopping in this isolated spot.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by the surrounding context:\n1. They're stopping "between the woods and frozen lake"\n2. There's no farmhouse nearby\n3. It's "the darkest evening of the year"\n4. The horse even "gives his harness bells a shake/To ask if there is some mistake"\n\nAll these details reinforce that this is an unusual stop in an uncommon place at an odd time, which would naturally seem strange or "queer" to the horse, who would be accustomed to stopping only at destinations like farmhouses or other buildings, not in the middle of a snowy woods.	2025-01-03 04:38:12.006269	null	0

They are riding into "the field of Gondor" where Minas Tirith is under siege by the forces of the Black Captain (the Witch-king of Angmar)\n\n2. The word "Ride" becomes particularly significant as it transforms from a simple action into a battle cry. It appears prominently in Théoden's rousing speech: "Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\n3. The context shows this isn't just any ride - it's:\n- A military charge\n- A response to Gondor's call for aid\n- A potentially decisive moment in the battle for Minas Tirith\n- A moment of transformation from hesitation to decisive action\n\nThe repetition of "Ride" emphasizes both the Rohirrim's identity as horsemen and the urgency of their charge. The word changes from describing physical movement to becoming a powerful call to action that symbolizes hope, courage, and the fulfillment of alliances.\n\nThe text indicates this ride is happening at dawn, with the first light breaking through, making it both literally and metaphorically a ride from darkness into light.	2025-01-03 04:51:08.638225	null	0
f2a27d66-22f5-4309-8b76-1c3adf4de9b7	\N	assistant	Based on the provided text, inflation expectations impact bond yields and prices in several key ways:\n\n1. Direct Relationship with Required Returns:\n- The text states that "the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations"\n- This means investors adjust their required returns based on what they expect inflation to be\n\n2. Central Bank Response Mechanism:\n- The text notes that "Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy"\n- This is exemplified by the July 2023 FOMC meeting mention, where the Fed raised rates to 5.25%-5.50% specifically to combat inflation\n\n3. Real Value Erosion:\n- The text explicitly states that "Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value"\n- This is particularly important for "longer maturity debts" as they are exposed to inflation risk for a longer period\n\n4. Price Sensitivity:\n- The document emphasizes that "bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts"\n- This creates what's known as "interest rate risk," which is defined as "the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates"\n\nThrough these mechanisms, higher inflation expectations typically lead to:\n- Higher required yields from investors\n- Lower bond prices (since prices and yields move inversely)\n- Increased interest rate risk for bondholders\n\nThis is currently relevant as evidenced by the mention of the 10-year Treasury yielding around 4%, reflecting current inflation concerns and Fed policy responses.	2025-01-03 13:03:14.065155	null	0

An Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) is used when:\n- The rent is less than £100,000.00 per annum\n- The property is used as the tenant's main home\n\n2. A Non-Housing Act Tenancy is used when:\n- The rent is £100,000.00 or more per annum\n- OR when the property is not occupied as the tenant's main home\n\nThe document specifically requires tenants to warrant that "this property will be your main home," indicating the importance of this distinction. However, the chunk doesn't explicitly detail the implications of these different tenancy types.\n\nImportant considerations:\n1. The requirement for a warranty (declaration) about main home status suggests this is a material fact that could affect the legal relationship between landlord and tenant\n2. The distinction between tenancy types implies different legal frameworks and potentially different rights and protections\n3. The explicit mention of this in the confirmation of offer suggests it's a crucial factor in determining the type of contract used\n\nWithout access to additional document sections detailing the specific differences between AST and Non-Housing Act Tenancies, I cannot make definitive statements about the exact implications. Would you like to examine other chunks of the document that might provide more detail about these different tenancy types and their implications?	2025-01-03 22:12:45.301393	null	0
95a24c3a-2ad6-4407-a404-92b51b22c04c	\N	assistant	From this passage, Rohan is riding to aid Minas Tirith (the city of Gondor) which is under siege and in dire distress. This is evident from several key details in the text:\n\n1. The city is described as "the falling city" and there's mention of "fires of the siege"\n\n2. The text notes "a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death," indicating Minas Tirith is under heavy attack\n\n3. There's a sense of urgency and near-despair, shown in the lines "They were too late! Too late was worse than never!"\n\n4. The situation is so grave that Théoden (the king of Rohan) is momentarily overcome, described as seeming to "shrink down, cowed by age" as he witnesses "the agony of Minas Tirith"\n\n5. However, after a change in the wind and a great boom from the city, Théoden rallies and calls his riders to action with his famous cry "Ride to Gondor!"\n\nThe Rohirrim (the riders of Rohan) are essentially coming to fulfill their alliance with Gondor, riding to defend their allies in their moment of greatest need. The passage captures the dramatic moment when they transition from silent approach to their full-throated charge to save the besieged city.	2025-01-03 04:46:37.615689	null	0

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now!

Alfred Prufrock," which begins with an epigraph in Italian from Dante's Inferno. The poem is a modernist masterpiece that depicts the psychological anxiety and paralysis of its narrator, a middle-aged man wrestling with existential concerns.\n\nKey elements of this section include:\n\n1. The Opening Scene:\n- Sets up an evening cityscape with the striking medical metaphor "Like a patient etherised upon a table"\n- Introduces a journey through "half-deserted streets" and "cheap hotels"\n\n2. The Recurring Refrain:\n"In the room the women come and go\nTalking of Michelangelo"\n- Creates a sense of superficial social interaction and cultural pretension\n\n3. The Yellow Fog Section:\n- Personifies fog/smoke as a cat-like creature\n- Creates a dreamy, atmospheric urban setting\n\n4. The Theme of Time:\n- Multiple references to "there will be time"\n- Shows the narrator's procrastination and anxiety about decisions\n- "measured out my life with coffee spoons" suggests a life lived in small, careful increments\n\n5. Social Anxiety:\n- The narrator's self-consciousness about his appearance ("How his hair is growing thin!")\n- The overwhelming question of whether to "disturb the universe"\n- Constant second-guessing and "decisions and revisions"\n\nThe overall tone is one of hesitation, social awkwardness, and existential uncertainty, captured through stream-of-consciousness style and various modernist techniques. The narrator appears trapped between desire for meaningful connection and paralyzing self-doubt.	2025-01-03 04:55:22.007743	null	0

Here's the translation and meaning:\n\n"If I thought my answer were given\nto anyone who could ever return to the world,\nthis flame would stay still without further movement.\nBut since none from this depth\nhas ever returned alive, if what I hear is true,\nwithout fear of infamy I answer you."\n\nThe key meaning here is:\n1. The speaker is a damned soul in Hell, speaking from within a flame\n2. He's only willing to tell his story because he believes his listener cannot return to the living world to repeat it\n3. He's concerned about his reputation ("infamy") but feels safe speaking because he thinks his words won't reach the living world\n4. There's deep irony here because he IS speaking to Dante, who will indeed return and share his story\n\nThis passage is particularly significant because it opens T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" - Eliot uses it as an epigraph, drawing a parallel between the damned soul's secret confession and Prufrock's own internal monologue that follows. Both speakers share their private thoughts only because they believe they won't face consequences for doing so.	2025-01-03 04:55:39.132264	null	0

ce2bfaac-a1c8-4e5c-9965-53479c496cd6	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nThe Ride of the Rohirrim\n\nNow silently, the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of Gondor, pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure. The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nlast\n\nYour role is to:\n1. Help users understand this section in detail\n2. Focus particularly on the highlighted portion\n3.

10d93397-d407-4829-9bc9-b2275dcc430f	\N	assistant	Hello! I'm here to help you analyze this passage, which is from "The Return of the King" by J.R.R. Tolkien, describing the famous "Ride of the Rohirrim" scene. This is one of the most dramatic moments in the book, where King Théoden and the Riders of Rohan arrive to aid Minas Tirith during its siege.\n\nWould you like to discuss:\n1. The dramatic build-up and mood of the scene\n2. The symbolism and imagery used\n3. The character development of Théoden\n4. The literary techniques Tolkien employs\n5. Any specific aspect that interests you most?\n\nThe passage moves from a moment of doubt and darkness to one of heroic inspiration, culminating in Théoden's famous battle cry.

Immediate Financial Commitment\n- Requires payment equivalent to one week's rent upfront\n- Must be paid from personal bank account (not company or third-party accounts)\n\nRisk Factors:\n1. Potential Loss of Deposit if:\n- Tenant decides not to proceed\n- Unreasonably delays responding to requests\n- Provides false/misleading information\n- Fails Immigration Act 2014 checks\n\n2. Timeline Pressures:\n- Standard 15-day completion window for paperwork\n- Can be extended by agreement\n- Delays in responding could result in deposit loss\n\nProtection Elements:\n1. Tenant Safeguards:\n- Deposit refundable within 7 days if landlord declines for unrelated reasons\n- Right to seek independent legal advice explicitly mentioned\n- Clear documentation of refund conditions\n\nDecision-Making Impact:\n1. Commitment Level:\n- Forces serious consideration before applying\n- Discourages speculative applications\n- Financial stake in the process\n\n2. Application Readiness:\n- Need to have all documentation prepared\n- Must be confident about passing immigration checks\n- Requires prompt communication capabilities\n\n3. Financial Planning:\n- Need available funds from personal account\n- Must consider potential loss of deposit\n- Week's rent tied up during application process\n\nThese factors would likely encourage potential tenants to:\n1. Be certain about their interest in the property\n2. Have all necessary documentation ready\n3. Ensure they meet all eligibility criteria\n4. Be prepared for prompt communication\n5. Have sufficient funds available in their personal account\n\nThe process effectively creates a screening mechanism that favors committed and prepared applicants while potentially deterring casual inquiries or multiple simultaneous applications.	2025-01-03 22:13:09.390373	null	0
420264d7-c530-43d7-a424-74df9292af10	\N	assistant	Based on the provided text, I can explain the relationship between Fed rate hikes and bond pricing/yields:\n\n1. Direct Impact:\n- According to the text, when the Fed raises rates (as they did in July 2023 to 5.25%-5.50%), this affects bond prices through "interest rate risk"\n- The text establishes a fundamental inverse relationship: "Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa)"\n\n2. Term Structure Effects:\n- The text mentions that "Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways"\n- As an example, it notes that while the Fed raised rates to the 5.25%-5.50% range, the 10-year Treasury was "hovering roughly around 4%"\n\n3. Underlying Mechanism:\n- The text explains that a bond represents "a stream of future cash payments"\n- The value of these payments is determined by "your required return based on your inflation expectations"\n- When the Fed raises rates to combat inflation, it affects these required returns and thus the present value of those future payments\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the text doesn't provide detailed specifics about how the impact differs between long-term and short-term bonds, though it acknowledges that such differences exist. For a complete analysis of term structure effects, we might need additional information beyond what's provided in this chunk.\n\n4. Policy Context:\n- The text mentions that these rate hikes are part of the Fed's strategy to "bring down inflation," suggesting a broader monetary policy framework affecting bond markets	2025-01-04 00:01:24.59982	null	0

d0f556c2-aa58-40fd-819d-ef43c4aae24e	\N	assistant	"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" is one of Robert Frost's most famous poems, and it operates on multiple levels of meaning:\n\nOn a literal level, it describes a person stopping their horse-drawn sleigh to watch snow falling in the woods on a dark winter evening. The speaker is presumably making a journey and has paused, despite having obligations ("promises to keep") and distance still to travel ("miles to go").\n\nOn a deeper symbolic level, the poem explores several key themes:\n\n1. The tension between duty and desire:\n- The speaker is drawn to the beautiful, peaceful woods\n- But is pulled by responsibilities and commitments\n- This represents the conflict between wanting to pause/escape and needing to fulfill obligations\n\n2. Isolation and contemplation:\n- The setting is solitary ("He will not see me stopping here")\n- The only sounds are the horse's bells, wind, and snow\n- This creates a moment of deep personal reflection\n\n3. The allure of darkness/death:\n- The woods are described as "lovely, dark and deep"\n- It's "the darkest evening of the year"\n- Some interpret this as representing the temptation of death or oblivion\n\n4. The repetition of the final line "And miles to go before I sleep" adds emphasis and can be read two ways:\n- Literally: physical distance to travel\n- Metaphorically: tasks/obligations in life before death ("sleep")\n\nThe poem's power comes from its deceptive simplicity - while it appears to be a straightforward nature poem, it contains deeper meditations on life, death, duty, and human nature.	2025-01-03 06:31:12.665724	null	0

e79dd5f3-f7ad-44e5-a1b6-71ae2ac5e4b3	\N	assistant	Based on the provided chunk of text, this specific relationship between federal funds rate and common stock prices is not directly addressed. The text primarily focuses on the relationship between interest rates, bond prices, and inflation.\n\nHowever, I can explain that the text does establish some foundational concepts that hint at this relationship:\n\n1. Interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship - when rates rise, bond prices fall and vice-versa.\n\n2. The text mentions how the Federal Reserve uses interest rates to control inflation, as evidenced by the July 2023 FOMC meeting where they raised rates to "bring down inflation."\n\nTo properly answer your specific question about common stocks, we would need additional text that discusses the relationship between interest rates and equity markets. Without that context, I cannot make claims about how lower federal funds rates affect stock prices, as that would go beyond the scope of the provided document.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Focus more on the bond-interest rate relationship that is detailed in the text?\n2. Wait for additional chunks that might address stock market relationships?	2025-01-03 06:33:00.907945	null	0

Foundational Principles:\n- The declaration of states being "free and independent" established the fundamental basis of American sovereignty and self-governance that continues today\n- The powers outlined (to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce) remain core functions of the federal government\n\n2. Democratic Values:\n- The concept of representative government ("representatives... in general congress assembled") remains the cornerstone of American democracy\n- The emphasis on collective decision-making and mutual commitment ("we mutually pledge") reflects ongoing American values of democratic participation\n\n3. Federation Structure:\n- The listing of individual colonies/states with their representatives laid the groundwork for the federal system still in use\n- The balance between state and national identity remains a crucial aspect of American governance\n\n4. Moral and Legal Framework:\n- The appeal to both divine authority ("Supreme Judge of the world") and human rights reflects the ongoing tension between religious and secular influences in American society\n- The concept of pledging "lives, fortunes, and sacred honor" established a tradition of civic duty and sacrifice for the greater good\n\n5. International Relations:\n- The powers claimed (especially regarding commerce and alliances) continue to define America's role in global affairs\n- The assertion of independence from foreign control remains relevant to modern American foreign policy and sovereignty\n\nThis document remains a living testament to core American principles and continues to influence political discourse, legal interpretation, and national identity in the modern United States.	2025-01-03 06:40:52.153953	null	3

5c3d8091-0129-4609-9bbe-b7188e59ebab	\N	assistant	The poem's language and meter brilliantly reflect this central tension through several technical elements:\n\n1. Rhythmic Structure:\n- The poem follows a strict iambic tetrameter pattern (4 beats per line)\n- This regular rhythm mirrors:\n  * The steady pace of travel\n  * The horse's trotting\n  * The methodical falling of snow\n- Yet there are moments where the rhythm seems to pause or linger, reflecting the speaker's temptation to stay\n\n2. Rhyme Scheme (aaba, bbcb, etc.):\n- The tight rhyme pattern suggests order and control\n- The third line of each stanza breaks the pattern before returning\n- This mirrors the speaker's momentary deviation from their journey\n- The perfect rhymes suggest inevitability of continuing onward\n\n3. Word Choice Contrasts:\nPeaceful/Contemplative:\n- "lovely, dark and deep"\n- "easy wind and downy flake"\n- "watch his woods fill up with snow"\n\nDuty/Movement:\n- "promises to keep"\n- "miles to go"\n- "shake" and "mistake"\n\n4. Sound Patterns:\n- Soft sounds ("downy," "snow," "easy") reflect the woods' tranquility\n- Harder sounds ("shake," "keep") emphasize responsibility\n- The famous final repetition "And miles to go before I sleep" combines:\n  * Rhythmic steadiness suggesting inevitability\n  * A hypnotic quality suggesting temptation to rest\n\nThe formal elements thus enact the poem's tension between duty and desire, structure and surrender, movement and stillness. The disciplined form itself becomes a kind of "promise to keep" even as the language within it expresses longing for release.	2025-01-04 05:56:04.427196	null	0

He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far\n\naway, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote\n\ngrey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.\n\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning\n\nhad sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!\n\nWith that he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-\n\nbearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder.\n\nAnd straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in\n\nmusic, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour\n\nwas like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the\n\nmountains.\n\nRide now, ride now!

This whole scene is actually one of the most famous in the entire Lord of the Rings series. The flash works like a dramatic lighting change in a movie - it illuminates everything in stark "black and white" for a second, creating this frozen moment of crisis right before everything explodes into action.\n\nThink of it like a match being struck in the darkness - that sudden flash shows how desperate things are for Minas Tirith, but it also sparks Théoden's transformation from a hesitant old king into this legendary warrior. The way Tolkien writes it builds so much tension:\n\n1. First there's all this doubt and waiting\n2. Then this ominous flash from below (super unnatural)\n3. Then BOOM - literally, with that thunder\n4. And suddenly Théoden is transformed, giving one of the most famous speeches in fantasy literature\n\nThat "woah" reaction you had? That's exactly what Tolkien was going for - this massive shift from tension to explosive action. Pretty cool how a single flash can carry so much dramatic weight, right?	2025-01-07 03:13:20.201521	null	0

As an AI assistant specializing in document analysis, I can help you understand and analyze this poem in detail. \n\nThis is a four-stanza poem that tells the story of someone who stops to observe a snow-covered woods during what appears to be a journey. The poem is known for its vivid imagery, contemplative tone, and its famous repeated final lines.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Break down the poem's structure and form\n2. Analyze its key themes and symbolism\n3. Discuss specific imagery and word choices\n4. Examine the narrative perspective\n5. Focus on any particular aspect that interests you?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to explore this poem, and I'll provide a focused analysis grounded in the text.	2025-01-03 06:46:46.569433	null	0
dae511b5-098c-452d-9cc5-67cb2322f70b	\N	assistant	In these lines, "he" refers to the owner of the woods that the narrator is observing. The poem establishes this in the opening line "Whose woods these are I think I know."\n\nThe highlighted lines tell us two important things about this owner:\n1. He lives in the village (not near these woods)\n2. He's physically absent from the scene\n\nThis absence is significant because:\n- It creates a sense of solitude for the narrator\n- It suggests the narrator might be trespassing or at least stopping without permission\n- The phrase "He will not see me" implies both physical absence and a hint of secrecy\n\nWhile the owner's specific identity isn't revealed, his role in the poem is to establish the narrator's solitary presence in these woods - the owner's absence allows for this private moment of contemplation.\n\nThe "though" at the end of "His house is in the village though" serves as a kind of reassurance to the narrator that their moment of observation won't be interrupted.	2025-01-03 17:05:10.098558	null	0

Current context (July 2023 Fed rate increase to 5.25%-5.50%)\n4. The relationship between inflation and interest rates\n\nWould you like to explore any of these topics in particular?

Connects the subject (Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury) to its designation/classification (U.S. Treasury bonds)\n2. Establishes a definition or naming convention for these specific financial instruments\n3. Functions in the present tense, indicating this is an ongoing, current classification\n\nThe sentence introduces a key concept in the text, transitioning from general bond discussion to specifically defining U.S. Treasury securities. This definition is particularly relevant because:\n\n1. It follows discussion of bond risks\n2. Sets up the distinction between bills, notes, and bonds based on maturity\n3. Provides context for the earlier mention of the "10-year Treasury" hovering around 4%\n\nWithin the broader text's themes of interest rates, bond yields, and inflation, this definitional sentence helps establish the foundational understanding of one of the most important types of bonds discussed in the passage.	2025-01-03 06:48:01.169044	null	0

a33c9981-e4c3-42e6-8988-dc24c804b002	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nInterest Rates, Bond Yields, and Inflation\n\nOwning a bond is essentially like possessing a stream of future cash payments. Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments. The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price – the higher the risk of a negative credit event occurring, the higher the interest rate investors will demand in exchange for assuming that risk.\n\nBonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the operation of the U.S. government are known as U.S. Treasury bonds. Depending on the time until maturity, they are called bills, notes, or bonds.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nare\n\nYour role is to:\n1. Help users understand this section in detail\n2.

In a legal or practical sense, "owning the woods" typically means:\n- Having property rights over the land\n- Having the authority to permit or deny access\n- Being able to use or develop the land\n\nBut the poem suggests some tension between legal ownership and natural spaces:\n1. The owner is physically and emotionally disconnected from the woods (being in the village)\n2. Nature itself - the snow, woods, wind - seems to operate independently of human ownership\n3. The narrator's ability to stop and appreciate the woods challenges the practical meaning of ownership\n\nThe highlighted lines particularly emphasize this tension:\n- "His house is in the village though" suggests the owner's separation from what he legally owns\n- "He will not see me stopping here" implies that true appreciation of the woods belongs more to the observer than the legal owner\n\nThis raises philosophical questions:\n- Can anyone truly "own" nature?\n- Is the person who stops to appreciate the woods more genuinely connected to them than the legal owner?\n- Does ownership matter in moments of natural beauty and contemplation?	2025-01-03 17:06:17.084657	null	0

Key Principles:\n- Each birth has a 50% chance of being a girl\n- Births are mutually independent (previous births don't affect future ones)\n- Parents stop when they get a girl\n\n2. Why it stays 50%:\n- Every time a child is born, it's still a 50-50 chance regardless of:\n  * Parents' preferences\n  * Previous children\n  * Whether parents will continue having more children\n- The stopping rule (stopping when getting a girl) doesn't change the probability of each individual birth\n- Each birth is an independent event with the same 50% probability\n\n3. Common Misconception:\nThe solution specifically mentions that many people, even those who studied probability, incorrectly think there will be more girls. This misconception might come from:\n- Focusing on the parents' preference for girls\n- Thinking about the stopping rule (stopping at girls)\n- Not fully grasping that the biological probability remains unchanged\n\n4. Key Insight:\nThe fraction of girls is determined by the biological probability (50%) at each birth, not by:\n- Parents' preferences\n- Stopping rules\n- Previous birth outcomes\n\nThe solution emphasizes that you should focus on the two fundamental facts: the 50% probability and independence of events. These biological facts override any human preference or behavior patterns in determining the overall gender ratio.	2025-01-03 22:13:51.312344	null	0

This chunk contains several key elements:\n\n1. The formal introduction announcing the unanimous declaration of the 13 United States\n2. The philosophical preamble explaining natural rights and the purpose of government\n3. The introduction to grievances against King George III\n\nWould you like to explore any particular aspect of this section? We could discuss:\n- The philosophical principles outlined in the document\n- The structure and rhetoric of the opening paragraphs\n- The specific grievances mentioned in this section\n- The historical context of its writing\n- The key concepts of natural rights and government by consent\n\nWhat interests you most about this portion of the document?	2025-01-03 06:49:38.493842	null	0
1da30c71-daa2-4daa-b89c-0342f46ae2b3	\N	assistant	Based on the text, the Rohirrim (the mounted warriors of Rohan) are:\n\n1. Quietly advancing into the field of Gondor, moving slowly and steadily ("pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide")\n\n2. Following King Théoden eastward, positioning themselves between the siege fires and the outer fields, preparing to attack the forces besieging Minas Tirith\n\n3. Initially waiting without action - the text notes that "Théoden gave no signal" and they remain "unchallenged"\n\n4. Experiencing a moment of tension and uncertainty as their king appears to hesitate, seeming "cowed by age" while observing the burning city of Minas Tirith\n\n5. Finally, after a change in the wind and a flash from the city, they are rallied by Théoden's dramatic call to arms ("Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!")\n\n6. Preparing for an imminent charge after Théoden blows a horn (which bursts from the force) and all their horns join in "like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains"\n\nThe scene captures their transition from a stealthy approach to what appears to be the beginning of a massive cavalry charge toward Gondor.	2025-01-03 06:52:19.504385	null	0

2900258e-1a5d-4e41-ab6a-36eb84b4e5a3	\N	assistant	Let me help break down what's happening here:\n\n"The Ride of the Rohirrim" depicts a pivotal moment before a major battle, with several key elements:\n\n1. Initial Approach\n- The Rohirrim (horsemen of Rohan) are moving silently toward Minas Tirith\n- They're undetected by the enemy (specifically the Black Captain)\n- They position themselves between the siege fires and outer fields\n\n2. Moment of Crisis\n- King Théoden appears to falter, showing signs of age and dread\n- There's a heavy atmosphere of doubt and horror\n- Merry (a hobbit observer) fears they might be too late\n- The text creates tension about whether Théoden might retreat\n\n3. The Turning Point\n- A dramatic change in weather occurs (wind and light appear)\n- A flash and boom from the city serve as catalysts\n- This moment transforms Théoden completely\n\n4. The Rally\n- Théoden transforms from "bent shape" to "tall and proud"\n- He delivers a powerful battle cry: "Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!"\n- The speech invokes imagery of battle ("spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered")\n- The moment culminates in the blowing of horns, with Théoden's horn bursting from the force\n\nThe passage masterfully builds tension before releasing it in a powerful climactic moment, marking a transition from doubt to decisive action.\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these aspects in more detail?	2025-01-03 07:03:23.230643	null	0

Appel accentuated the prev-\nalence of the “photography theme” (141) in Nabokov's novels and the significance\nof visual images, which, in Appel's opinion, are indicative of his poetic reality.\nAppel questioned Nabokov about the relation between his visual sense and poetics,\ninquiring whether he had studied the science of optics. Nabokov answered that\n“even with the best of vision one must touch things to be quite sure of ‘reality”\n(141), affirming that one cannot grasp “reality” by mere optical perception. How-\never, Nabokov rejected Appel's inference that his own photography theme in Lolita\nreferenced Lewis Carroll's perverse hobby of taking pictures of semi-undressed lit-\ntle girls. This definite answer prevented Appel from further exploring the theme of\nvisual imagery in Nabokov's poetics, especially in Lolita. The photography theme is\nevident in this novel, but, like an overexposed image, it loses its sharpness due to its\nown prevalence. My task in this article is, in Nabokov's own words, to “eliminate all\nthe superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision," to\nsharpen the focus and create the “final picture” (Nabokov, Lolita 125) from these\noverexposed “images.”\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nLewis Carroll's perverse hobby\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

Specifically, the text comes from what appears to be an academic article analyzing these themes.\n\nThe key points being discussed are:\n\n1. A 1966 interview between Nabokov and Alfred Appel Jr. about the role of visual perception and photography in Nabokov's work\n\n2. The highlighted portion references Lewis Carroll (author of "Alice in Wonderland") and his controversial hobby of photographing young girls. This comes up because Appel apparently tried to draw a parallel between Carroll's photography and Nabokov's use of photographic themes in "Lolita."\n\n3. Importantly, Nabokov explicitly rejected this comparison to Carroll, shutting down that line of interpretation.\n\n4. The author of this article suggests that while photography is indeed an important theme in "Lolita," it needs to be analyzed more carefully, removing the "blur" to find the true meaning.\n\nThe reference to Lewis Carroll's "perverse hobby" is particularly significant because it highlights the sensitive nature of both works' treatment of young girls, though Nabokov apparently wanted to distance himself from any comparison to Carroll's real-life activities.	2025-01-03 22:26:26.508029	null	0

019805da-6fb7-43a7-bffe-a281ee7507c0	\N	assistant	Théoden's transformation in this passage serves as a powerful metaphor for the entire Rohirrim force, and it can be analyzed through several key stages:\n\n1. Initial Doubt and Weariness:\n- The passage first shows Théoden as "shrink[ing] down, cowed by age"\n- He appears defeated, with Merry observing him as if he might "quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills"\n- This represents the initial weight of despair and uncertainty hanging over the entire army\n\n2. The Pivotal Moment:\n- The transformation is triggered by a natural change: "Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering"\n- This is followed by the dramatic flash from Minas Tirith and the "great boom"\n- These elements serve as catalysts for both Théoden's and the army's awakening\n\n3. The Dramatic Transformation:\n- Théoden suddenly springs "erect," becoming "Tall and proud" again\n- His voice becomes supernaturally powerful - "more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before"\n- This physical and spiritual transformation symbolizes the Rohirrim's collective rise from doubt to determination\n\n4. The Culmination:\n- The breaking of the horn and the responsive chorus of horns represents the way Théoden's individual transformation cascades through the entire army\n- The description "like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains" shows how his personal courage has amplified into a massive force\n\nThis progression from despair to determination mirrors how the entire host of Rohan transforms from a cautious, doubt-filled force into a powerful, unified army ready for battle. Théoden's personal journey from apparent senility to legendary leadership becomes the catalyst for the army's larger transformation.	2025-01-04 05:58:39.347769	null	0

05b5627d-08f0-4b1d-8acb-b5c1bd56fcbd	\N	assistant	Merry's emotional experience serves as a powerful microcosm of the larger group's emotional state, offering insight into both individual and collective psychology. Let's analyze this parallel:\n\n1. Shared Experience of Doubt and Dread:\n- Individual (Merry): "a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly"\n- Collective: Reflected in the uneasy horses and the host's uncertain advance\n- The personal detail of Merry's slowing heartbeat makes the collective anxiety more tangible and relatable\n\n2. Perception of Time and Urgency:\n- Individual (Merry): "Time seemed poised in uncertainty"\n- Collective: Shown in the slow, hesitant advance ("pouring in slowly but steadily")\n- Both perspectives capture the psychological weight of waiting before battle\n\n3. Recognition of Change:\n- Individual (Merry): "Then suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change"\n- Collective: Manifested in the subsequent transformation of the entire host through the horn-blowing sequence\n\nThis parallel suggests several things about group dynamics:\n- Individual experiences often mirror and validate collective emotions\n- Group morale can be understood through the lens of personal experience\n- The tension between individual fear and collective courage\n- How shared moments of transformation can unite individual and group experiences\n\nThe passage uses Merry's perspective as a narrative device to:\n- Make the large-scale event more personally accessible\n- Show how individuals process and participate in momentous historical events\n- Demonstrate how personal and collective courage are interrelated\n\nThis suggests that within group dynamics, individual experiences aren't lost but rather become part of a larger shared narrative while maintaining their personal significance.	2025-01-04 05:59:24.117762	null	0
250f4ba4-e17b-4a15-b477-b660e566b604	\N	assistant	The sensory imagery in this passage creates a rich, multi-layered atmosphere that builds tension and urgency in several key ways:\n\n1. Olfactory Imagery:\n- "A smell of burning was in the air" - This immediate, visceral detail creates a sense of imminent danger\n- It connects readers directly to the destruction of Minas Tirith and makes the peril tangible\n- Pairs with "a very shadow of death" to create an oppressive atmosphere\n\n2. Visual Imagery:\n- Progresses from darkness to light symbolically:\n  * Initially dark and foreboding\n  * The dramatic "flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth"\n  * The city "dazzling far off in black and white"\n  * Finally, the promise of "morning" beyond the clouds\n- This visual progression mirrors the scene's emotional journey\n\n3. Auditory Imagery:\n- Builds from silence to crescendo:\n  * Starts with the silent movement ("silently, the host of Rohan moved forward")\n  * The singular "great boom" from the city\n  * Culminates in the overwhelming sound of horns "like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains"\n- The horn sequence particularly emphasizes the transformation from individual to collective action\n\nThe sensory progression creates tension by:\n- Moving from subtle to overwhelming sensations\n- Engaging multiple senses simultaneously\n- Using natural imagery (storm, thunder) to emphasize the magnitude of the moment\n- Creating a sense of building pressure that finally releases with the horns' blast\n\nThis careful layering of sensory details helps readers feel physically present in the scene and emotionally invested in its outcome, making the ultimate call to action more powerful and immediate.	2025-01-04 05:59:08.891787	null	0
795b072c-cc06-4895-83cb-ca675896557a	\N	assistant	The transformation in Théoden's demeanor plays a pivotal role in this passage and illustrates powerful themes about leadership and morale. Let's analyze this in detail:\n\n1. Initial Mood and Demeanor:\n- The text shows Théoden initially "shrink down, cowed by age"\n- He appears hesitant and almost defeated, described as if he might "quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills"\n- This uncertainty affects the entire host, as evidenced by Merry's observation that "Time seemed poised in uncertainty"\n\n2. The Transformation:\n- The change comes with a dramatic shift in nature itself ("Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering")\n- Théoden transforms from "bent shape" to "Tall and proud"\n- His voice becomes supernatural in its power ("more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before")\n\n3. Impact on the Host:\n- The king's transformation cascades through the army, symbolized by the horns of Rohan rising up "like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains"\n- His individual action (blowing the horn until it bursts) triggers a collective response (all horns joining in music)\n\nThis passage suggests several things about leadership:\n- Leaders' moods and bearing directly affect their followers' morale\n- A single moment of decisive action can transform collective doubt into purpose\n- True leadership involves not just physical direction but emotional and spiritual inspiration\n\nThe text demonstrates how the emotional state of a leader can either paralyze or galvanize an entire army, suggesting that leadership is as much about emotional courage as it is about strategic decision-making.	2025-01-04 05:58:57.669483	null	0
84334b69-6783-404f-af73-7dc54d72f571	\N	assistant	The phrase "darkest evening of the year" serves multiple important functions in developing the poem's themes:\n\n1. Physical and Symbolic Darkness:\n- It literally sets the scene during what is likely the winter solstice\n- The extreme darkness amplifies the sense of isolation and contemplation\n- Creates a liminal space between day and night, civilization and wilderness\n\n2. Psychological Weight:\n- The darkness mirrors the speaker's internal state of contemplation\n- Emphasizes the allure of the "lovely, dark and deep" woods\n- Creates tension between duty ("promises to keep") and the desire to linger in this moment\n\n3. Temporal Significance:\n- Marks a turning point in the natural cycle of the year\n- Suggests a moment of pause and reflection\n- The speaker, like the year itself, is at a pivotal moment\n\n4. Enhanced Uncertainty:\n- The extreme darkness makes the familiar woods more mysterious\n- Contributes to the horse's unease ("must think it queer")\n- Makes the choice to stop here seem more significant and unusual\n\nThe setting works with other elements like the "frozen lake," "easy wind," and "downy flake" to create an atmosphere where the speaker can momentarily suspend normal obligations and consider deeper existential questions, before ultimately choosing to move on ("miles to go before I sleep").\n\nThis "darkest evening" setting is crucial in creating the space for the poem's central tension between the tempting stillness of the woods and the pull of worldly responsibilities.	2025-01-04 05:55:43.607573	null	0
bfb235df-d152-4feb-89c2-ef9cf4d3a4aa	\N	assistant	The natural imagery in the poem creates a fascinating tension between tranquility and urgency through several key contrasts:\n\n1. Peaceful Natural Elements:\n- "woods fill up with snow" - suggests gentle, gradual accumulation\n- "easy wind and downy flake" - soft, peaceful descriptors\n- "lovely, dark and deep" - inviting, almost hypnotic qualities\nThese elements create a sense of serene stillness and invite contemplation\n\n2. Contrasting Elements of Motion/Obligation:\n- The horse's restless behavior ("gives his harness bells a shake")\n- The repeated emphasis on "miles to go"\n- The implied journey through "between the woods and frozen lake"\nThese suggest forward momentum and responsibility\n\n3. Layered Imagery:\n- The "frozen lake" - represents both stillness and inhospitable conditions\n- The "woods" - simultaneously welcoming and potentially dangerous\n- The "snow" - beautiful but an impediment to travel\n\n4. Dynamic Tension:\nThe poem moves between:\n- Stationary moments ("stopping here")\n- Implied movement ("miles to go")\n- The physical landscape ("woods," "lake")\n- Human obligations ("promises to keep")\n\nThe repetition of "And miles to go before I sleep" in the final stanza serves as a stark reminder of urgency that breaks through the tranquil scene, suggesting that while nature offers peaceful respite, it cannot be fully embraced due to worldly commitments.\n\nThis interplay between peaceful natural imagery and elements suggesting urgency creates the poem's central conflict between desire (to stay and contemplate) and duty (to continue the journey).	2025-01-04 05:55:54.119209	null	0

dbbc2270-482c-4f78-9ce5-3a88b2ec7a49	\N	assistant	The Declaration justifies the colonies' decision to seek independence through several key philosophical and practical arguments presented in this opening section:\n\n1. Natural Rights Framework:\n- Establishes that all people have "unalienable rights" including "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"\n- Argues these rights come from "nature's God" and are therefore fundamental and universal\n\n2. Social Contract Theory:\n- States that governments derive their powers "from the consent of the governed"\n- Argues people have the right to alter or abolish governments that become "destructive of these ends"\n\n3. Threshold for Revolution:\n- Acknowledges that overthrowing governments shouldn't be done for "light and transient causes"\n- States that people typically prefer to "suffer, while evils are sufferable" rather than revolt\n- But asserts when there is a "long train of abuses and usurpations" leading to "absolute despotism," it becomes not just a right but a "duty" to overthrow such government\n\n4. Specific Justification:\n- Characterizes the colonies' situation as one of "patient sufferance"\n- Declares the King's actions show "repeated injuries and usurpations" aimed at establishing "absolute tyranny"\n- Offers to "submit facts to a candid world" to prove their case\n\nThe document is carefully structured to present independence as both a philosophical right and a practical necessity, moving from universal principles to specific grievances. This approach was designed to justify their actions both to their own people and to the international community, showing "decent respect to the opinions of mankind."\n\nThe opening sections establish the theoretical framework for revolution before moving to specific charges against King George III, building a comprehensive case for independence.	2025-01-04 10:30:21.172286	null	0
c9ffbc8c-7c6a-4355-9915-f6eeb6da339a	\N	assistant	In this opening section of the Declaration of Independence, the connection between governmental legitimacy and popular consent is established in several significant ways:\n\n1. Direct Statement of Principle:\nThe document explicitly states that "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." This is a foundational claim that directly ties legitimate political authority to the will of the people.\n\n2. Right to Alter or Abolish:\nThe text establishes that when a government becomes "destructive of these ends" (protecting unalienable rights), the people have the right to:\n- Alter or abolish the government\n- Institute new government\n- Organize powers in a form that best serves their "safety and happiness"\n\n3. Philosophical Framework:\nThe document constructs a logical sequence:\n- People have unalienable rights\n- Governments are created to secure these rights\n- Power flows upward from the people, not downward from the ruler\n\n4. Historical Significance:\nThis connection is particularly significant because it:\n- Directly challenges the prevailing doctrine of divine right of kings\n- Establishes popular sovereignty as the basis for legitimate government\n- Creates a philosophical foundation for democratic self-governance\n\nThe text carefully balances this principle by noting that governments should not be changed for "light and transient causes," but maintains that the ultimate authority rests with the governed, marking a revolutionary shift in political philosophy and practical governance.\n\nThis theoretical framework then serves to justify the practical actions the colonies are about to take, making it both a philosophical statement and a practical revolutionary document.	2025-01-04 10:30:43.898365	null	0

Here are the main ways to finance a film:\n\n1. Studio Financing (The Easiest But Most Exclusive Route):\n- Major studios like Warner Brothers or streaming services like Netflix might fully fund the film\n- The studio pays for everything and typically includes:\n  * Full budget coverage\n  * 10% fee to compensate producers\n  * 10% contingency for unexpected costs\n- The catch: This is only available to experienced producers with track records, and studios approve very few pitched projects\n- The trade-off: The studio owns the movie and controls the final cut\n\n2. Negative Pickup Deals:\n- A variation where a studio promises to pay for the film upon delivery\n- The producer needs to fund the production upfront\n- Payment is guaranteed once the film is completed\n\n3. Bank Loans Based on Pre-sales:\n- Producers can get loans using pre-sold distribution rights as collateral\n- Example: A German distributor might agree to buy rights to distribute the film in Germany\n- Challenge: Requires coordinating multiple agreements with different buyers who may have competing interests\n\n4. Protection Structure:\n- Most films are set up through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) - usually a corporation or LLC\n- This protects the personal assets of producers, parent companies, and investors\n- The SPV handles all contracts with cast, crew, investors, etc.\n\nThe key takeaway is that film financing is complex and risky, which is why there are various methods to secure funding and protect those involved. Each method has its own advantages and challenges, and the choice often depends on the producer's experience, connections, and the specific needs of the project.	2025-01-05 21:06:39.808027	null	1

Brand Value & Recognition\n- The domain "friend.com" is a premium, single-word domain that directly relates to the company's focus on AI companionship\n- Schiffmann's own quote suggests he believes in the value proposition: "Premium domains are expensive, but it's worth it"\n\n2. Financial Context\n- The company raised $2.5 million at a $50 million valuation (according to TechCrunch)\n- This suggests investors saw significant potential value in the company, which might have encouraged such a bold spending decision\n\n3. Strategic Priority\n- Spending $1.8M out of $2.5M (roughly 72% of total funds) indicates Schiffmann viewed the domain name as a critical strategic asset\n- This suggests he prioritized establishing a strong, memorable online presence over other potential early-stage investments\n\n4. Marketing & Accessibility\n- A simple, intuitive domain name like "friend.com" could provide:\n  - Easier brand recognition\n  - Better memorability\n  - Potentially higher organic traffic\n  - Enhanced credibility for an AI companion service\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the article doesn't explicitly state whether this decision was well-received by investors or industry experts, and spending such a large percentage of initial funding on a domain name could be seen as either visionary or risky depending on the long-term outcome.	2025-01-05 21:12:26.710339	null	0

Here's how this new information fits with our previous understanding:\n\nCompletion Bonds in Detail [Chunk 13]:\n1. Cost and Requirements:\n- Typically costs 3% or more of net production budget\n- Partial rebates possible if no claims made\n- Not available for low-budget films\n- Required by banks before loan disbursement\n\n2. Coverage:\n- Protects against unforeseen circumstances (weather, illness)\n- Covers star death scenarios\n- Either provides funds to finish film or\n- Reimburses investors if project can't be completed\n\n3. Bond Company Requirements:\n- Expert review of budget and production plans\n- Realistic cost estimates required\n- "Strike price" or "production price" calculation includes:\n  * Above and below-the-line costs\n  * Fringes\n  * Insurance\n  * Financing costs\n  * Bond guarantor's fee\n  * Contingency allowance\n\n4. Contingency Planning:\n- Usually 10% of direct expenses\n- Example: $2 million contingency on $20 million film\n- Must have signed contracts with director and stars\n- Mere interest from talent is insufficient\n\nThis information connects with previous chunks showing:\n- How it fits with studio financing [Chunk 1]\n- Its role in pre-sales [Chunk 2]\n- Integration with private placement structures [Chunk 12]\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

High Risk Industry\n- The document explicitly states that "most films are not financially successful endeavors"\n- Success is highly unpredictable - "no one can really predict the potential success of a film"\n- There is "significant financial risk with any production"\n\nProtection Mechanisms:\n1. Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)\n- Your investment would typically go through an SPV (corporation or LLC)\n- This provides some protection by isolating the project's liabilities\n- The SPV structure helps protect investors' other assets from project-related risks\n\nImportant Legal Considerations:\n1. The document mentions several regulatory frameworks that affect investors:\n- Private placement exemptions\n- Blue Sky Laws\n- Various SEC regulations (including Rules 504 and 506)\n- Security interest considerations\n\nRed Flags:\n1. If someone promises guaranteed success, be skeptical, as the industry acknowledges the inherent unpredictability\n2. Even major studios, with their extensive experience and resources, approve only a small percentage of projects\n\nRecommendations for Inexperienced Investors:\n1. Understand your position in the overall financing structure\n2. Verify that proper legal protections are in place\n3. Be prepared for the possibility of losing your investment\n4. Consider consulting with legal counsel familiar with film financing\n\nNote: For a more complete perspective, especially regarding specific investor protections and legal requirements, we would need to see additional sections of the document, particularly those covering investor protection and security interests, which are mentioned in the overview but not detailed in these chunks.\n\nWould you like me to look for more specific information about investor protections in other sections of the document?	2025-01-05 21:12:30.6031	null	1

Let me break down why this could indeed be seen as a questionable business decision:\n\n1. Financial Risk\n- Using 72% ($1.8M of $2.5M) of total startup capital on just a domain name leaves very little for:\n  - Product development\n  - Hiring talent\n  - Marketing and user acquisition\n  - Operating expenses\n  - Infrastructure costs\n\n2. Opportunity Cost\n- That $1.8M could have been used for:\n  - Building a stronger technical foundation\n  - Hiring more developers or AI experts\n  - Creating a marketing strategy\n  - Extended runway for the company\n\n3. Alternative Options\n- The company could have:\n  - Chosen a different, less expensive domain name\n  - Used a creative alternative domain extension\n  - Added a prefix or suffix to "friend" for a fraction of the cost\n\n4. Early-Stage Priority Misalignment\n- For an AI company, the quality of the technology and user experience would likely matter more than having a premium domain name\n- Early-stage startups typically prioritize product development over branding assets\n\nSo yes, spending such a large portion of initial funding on a domain name could be seen as misaligning priorities, especially for a technology company where the product itself should be the primary focus.	2025-01-05 21:12:57.812662	null	0

International Distribution System\n- Films are sold territory by territory through sales agents\n- Major markets occur in Cannes, Berlin, and Santa Monica (AFM)\n- Different territories (countries or regions) have different values and requirements\n\nKey Risk Factors Not Previously Mentioned:\n1. Pre-Sale Complications\n- Multiple approvals needed (script, budget, stars)\n- Territory buyers may demand specific actors for their markets\n- The film must satisfy multiple territory buyers' requirements\n- Even if pre-sales are secured, the film might "not turn out well"\n\nProtection Mechanisms:\n1. Completion Bonds\n- These act as insurance policies\n- Guarantee the film will be completed on time and within budget\n- If the film isn't completed, investors can get their money back\n- Many buyers require these bonds before committing\n\nBanking Considerations:\n1. Specialized Banking\n- Only a limited number of banks provide production financing\n- These banks specifically evaluate:\n  * Creditworthiness of territory buyers\n  * Likelihood of payment upon delivery\n\nAdditional Red Flags for Investors:\n1. Complex Dependencies\n- Success depends on multiple moving parts (script, stars, director, budget)\n- Long development times ("Writing a great script can take years")\n- Multiple approval requirements from various parties\n\nRecommendations for Inexperienced Investors:\n1. Verify if completion bonds are in place\n2. Understand which territories have committed to pre-sales\n3. Check the track record of the bank providing financing\n4. Research the reliability of territory buyers involved\n5. Understand how your investment fits into this complex distribution structure\n\nThis additional information reinforces that film investment is a complex, multi-party process with numerous interdependencies and risks that need to be carefully evaluated before making an investment decision.	2025-01-05 22:05:20.979255	null	2

Cash Flow Risk\n- Having only $700K remaining ($2.5M - $1.8M) for all other startup operations puts the company in a precarious financial position\n- This limited runway could force them to raise money again quickly, likely at less favorable terms\n\n2. Core Business Focus\n- As an AI companion company, their competitive advantage should come from:\n  - Superior AI technology\n  - Better user experience\n  - Strong engineering team\n  - Robust infrastructure\n- The domain name doesn't directly contribute to any of these crucial elements\n\n3. Alternative Strategy\nI would have recommended:\n- Choose a reasonable alternative domain for under $50K\n- Invest the remaining $1.75M in:\n  - Product development\n  - Key technical hires\n  - Initial marketing and user acquisition\n  - Operating runway\n\n4. Future Flexibility\n- They could always purchase the premium domain later if/when:\n  - The company proves successful\n  - They have more substantial funding\n  - The purchase wouldn't risk core operations\n\nThis appears to be a case of prioritizing prestige over practical business fundamentals, which is particularly risky for an early-stage startup in a competitive AI space.	2025-01-05 21:13:38.762277	null	0

Here are the key points about Canadian film production and investment:\n\nAdvantages of Canadian Production:\n1. Infrastructure\n- Toronto and Vancouver have extensive experienced crew bases\n- Multiple productions can shoot simultaneously\n- Well-developed production ecosystem\n\n2. Financial Benefits\n- Favorable exchange rates for U.S. dollar\n- Lower costs for goods and services\n- Multiple incentive programs\n\n3. Tax Incentive Structure:\n- Two-tier system:\n  * Higher tax credits for Canadian content films\n  * Lower but still substantial credits for non-Canadian content\n- Provincial government incentives can be combined with federal programs\n- Cannot combine Canadian content and non-Canadian content benefits simultaneously\n\n4. International Co-Production Opportunities:\n- Canada has over 50 co-production treaties\n- Allows combining incentives from multiple countries\n- Can stack benefits from different jurisdictions\n\nPotential Challenges:\n1. Requirements:\n- Must meet specific local element qualifications\n- Different standards for Canadian vs. non-Canadian content\n- Need to balance creative decisions with financial incentives\n\n2. Practical Considerations:\n- May need to factor in increased travel and accommodation costs\n- Need to evaluate equipment availability and technical support\n- Balance of creative needs vs. financial benefits\n\nWarning:\n- The document cautions against forcing changes to scripts and cast merely to attract co-financing ("Europudding")\n- Need to maintain creative integrity while pursuing financial benefits\n\nFor investors considering Canadian film projects, it's important to:\n1. Understand which tier of tax credits applies\n2. Consider provincial and federal incentives\n3. Evaluate potential co-production opportunities\n4. Factor in practical production considerations\n5. Verify that creative decisions aren't compromised by financial structuring\n\nFor more detailed information, the document recommends consulting Entertainment Partners for worldwide tax incentive information.	2025-01-05 22:21:24.813265	null	5

Specifically, these were used to fund:\n1. Police units\n2. Military guard units\n3. Schools\n\nThe passage indicates that these tankuan represented a new form of taxation that was part of the Guomindang's attempts to modernize and tighten control over village governance, marking a significant change from the previous Qing dynasty's more hands-off approach to village administration.\n\nThe increased burden of collecting these tankuan was apparently so significant that it led many village heads to try to resign from their positions, as they didn't want to be responsible for collecting these new taxes from their communities.	2025-01-06 06:39:14.687418	null	7

Here are the key insights from the text:\n\n1. Tension between Central Control and Local Autonomy:\n- The Qing dynasty practiced what appears to be "centralized minimalism" where village heads were largely left alone unless problems arose\n- The transition to Guomindang rule showed attempts to increase central control, which created resistance at the local level\n- This historical tension between central authority and local autonomy remains a relevant dynamic in Chinese governance\n\n2. Tax Collection and Administrative Burden:\n- The text shows how increased tax burdens and administrative responsibilities led to resistance from local officials\n- The Guomindang's attempt to modernize through increased taxation and direct village control represents an early version of state-building efforts\n- This created a pattern of local officials trying to avoid administrative duties when burdens became too heavy\n\n3. Bureaucratic Continuity:\n- The text notes that "village governance under the Guomindang in many respects changed little from that shown in the Qing Baodi archives"\n- This suggests a historical pattern of institutional persistence despite regime changes\n\nHowever, I should note that this chunk primarily discusses the transition from Qing to Guomindang rule, and any connections to contemporary practices would require additional historical evidence bridging to the present day. The text doesn't directly address current administrative approaches.	2025-01-06 06:40:13.539473	null	7

To examine income-related differences in life expectancy and causes of death in Norway\n2. To compare these differences with US estimates (though this part isn't detailed in this chunk)\n\nKEY RESULTS:\n1. Life Expectancy Gaps:\n- Women: Those in the top 1% income group lived 8.4 years longer than those in the bottom 1%\n- Men: Those in the top 1% income group lived 13.8 years longer than those in the bottom 1%\n\n2. Trends from 2005-2015:\n- The life expectancy gap between income groups increased\n- Women:\n  * Highest income quartile: Gained 3.2 years\n  * Lowest income quartile: Lost 0.4 years\n- Men:\n  * Highest income quartile: Gained 3.1 years\n  * Lowest income quartile: Gained only 0.9 years\n\n3. Major Causes of the Growing Gap:\n- In older age groups: cardiovascular disease, cancers, COPD, and dementia\n- In younger age groups: substance use deaths and suicides\n\nThe study was comprehensive, including over 3 million Norwegians aged 40+ years, following them for a decade (2005-2015), and analyzing over 441,768 deaths during this period.\n\nThis research highlights significant and growing health disparities based on income levels, even in Norway, which is known for its strong social welfare system.	2025-01-07 00:07:55.739616	null	0

The "8.4 years longer" statistic is looking at the absolute gap in life expectancy between income groups during the study period:\n- Women in top 1% income: life expectancy of 86.4 years\n- Women in bottom 1% income: life expectancy approximately 78 years (86.4 - 8.4)\nThis shows how long different groups could expect to live overall.\n\n2. The "gained 3.2 years" statistic is looking at how life expectancy changed over time (2005-2015):\n- Women in highest income quartile: gained 3.2 years over this decade\n- Women in lowest income quartile: lost 0.4 years over this decade\nThis shows how the situation changed during the study period.\n\nSo both statistics are correct but measure different things:\n- The first (8.4 years) shows the size of the gap between rich and poor\n- The second (3.2 years vs -0.4 years) shows how this gap grew wider over the study period because the rich gained more years while the poor actually lost some years\n\nThis helps demonstrate that not only was there a significant gap in life expectancy between income groups, but this gap actually increased over the decade studied.	2025-01-07 00:09:08.896083	null	0

However, the chunk does reveal some important patterns in Norway:\n\n1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the largest contributor to life expectancy gaps between income groups in Norway\n2. The life expectancy gap between income quartiles widened significantly from 2005 to 2015:\n   - For women: from 2.5 to 6.2 years\n   - For men: from 6.2 to 8.4 years\n3. Cancer mortality trends varied by income group (though specific details aren't provided in this chunk)\n\nTo properly compare causes of mortality between Norway and the US, we would need additional data from the study about US mortality patterns or access to other chunks that might contain this information. Making such a comparison without this data would be speculative.\n\nWould you like me to focus more specifically on the Norwegian mortality patterns, or would you like to look at other chunks that might contain US comparison data?	2025-01-07 00:12:51.68489	null	9
7fd03be9-577a-437e-b0e0-f25e41bbbca4	\N	system	You are analyzing a specific section of text.\n\nSECTION CONTENT:\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\n\nIN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776\n\nTHE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident—that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained, and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT:\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nYour role is to:\n1.

f1f5ad8e-02a5-4b70-8939-c8c5f97352d5	\N	assistant	The Declaration of Independence justifies the separation from Britain through several key philosophical and practical arguments that can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Natural Rights Philosophy:\n- The document grounds its argument in "laws of nature and nature's God," establishing a foundation in natural law theory\n- It declares certain rights as "self-evident" and "unalienable," including "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"\n- These rights are presented as divinely granted ("endowed by their Creator"), giving them supreme authority\n\n2. Social Contract Theory:\n- Governments derive their "just powers from the consent of the governed"\n- The purpose of government is specifically "to secure these rights"\n- When government becomes "destructive of these ends," people have the right to "alter or abolish it"\n\n3. Threshold for Revolution:\nThe document establishes a careful framework for justified revolution:\n- Revolution should not occur for "light and transient causes"\n- People naturally tend to suffer abuses rather than change established systems\n- Only "a long train of abuses and usurpations" pursuing "absolute despotism" justifies revolution\n- In such cases, it becomes not just a right but a "duty" to overthrow such government\n\n4. Procedural Justification:\n- The document shows "decent respect to the opinions of mankind"\n- It promises to "declare the causes" of separation\n- It offers to "submit facts to a candid world"\n\nThe philosophical underpinning is essentially a blend of Enlightenment principles about natural rights, social contract theory, and the right of revolution, while also establishing specific criteria for when revolution becomes justified. This creates both a philosophical and practical framework for their actions, making it both a revolutionary document and a reasoned legal argument.	2025-01-07 02:41:04.39892	null	0
22dff8f1-5c4c-4577-802d-c3a73c520184	\N	assistant	From this opening chunk of the Declaration, we can see how it portrays the King's actions as a fundamental threat in several key ways:\n\n1. Systematic Pattern of Abuse:\n- The text characterizes the King's actions not as isolated incidents but as "a history of repeated injuries and usurpations"\n- It emphasizes that these actions are deliberately pursuing "in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny"\n- The phrase "repeated injuries and usurpations" suggests calculated, ongoing oppression rather than occasional mistakes\n\n2. Direct Interference with Colonial Governance:\nFrom the specific examples given in this chunk:\n- "He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good"\n- "He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance"\n- These actions demonstrate direct obstruction of colonial self-governance and local needs\n\n3. Administrative Negligence:\n- The text notes that even when laws were suspended pending his approval, "he has utterly neglected to attend to them"\n- This shows a pattern of both active interference and passive obstruction\n\n4. Violation of Social Contract Principles:\nThe King's actions are portrayed as violating the fundamental principles established earlier in the document:\n- They counter the concept of "consent of the governed"\n- They threaten the "unalienable rights" previously described\n- They represent a move toward "absolute despotism"\n\n5. Systematic Breakdown:\n- The document portrays these actions as requiring the colonies to "alter their former systems of government"\n- It presents the situation as having reached the threshold of intolerable abuse described in the philosophical section\n\nThe Declaration thus builds a case that the King's actions represent not just poor governance but a fundamental threat to the very principles of self-governance and natural rights, meeting the threshold for justified revolution that it established in its philosophical opening.	2025-01-07 02:41:15.622831	null	0

ead1f3ff-c713-4562-8ce0-913ddf4e5aab	\N	assistant	The refusal to assent to laws would have had several significant negative impacts on colonial public welfare:\n\n1. Immediate Practical Effects:\n- Essential public services couldn't be established or improved\n- Local problems couldn't be addressed through legislation\n- Community needs went unmet despite colonial legislators' efforts\n\n2. Administrative Paralysis:\n- Colonial legislatures' attempts to govern effectively were blocked\n- Even widely supported and necessary laws couldn't be implemented\n- Created a bottleneck in colonial governance\n\n3. Public Health and Safety Issues:\n- The word "wholesome" suggests laws related to public health and well-being\n- Basic safety regulations couldn't be enacted\n- Community protection measures were prevented\n\n4. Economic Impact:\n- Commercial regulations needed for trade couldn't be established\n- Economic development was hindered\n- Local markets couldn't be properly regulated\n\n5. Colonial Self-Governance:\n- Demonstrates the frustration of having local needs ignored\n- Shows the practical problems of remote governance\n- Highlights the gap between colonial needs and royal response\n\nThis grievance is particularly powerful because it shows how the king's actions directly harmed the common good, violating the basic principle that government should serve the people's welfare.	2025-01-07 02:41:23.988801	null	0

12774624-c459-4cb9-b232-2d0ba2bc4454	\N	assistant	Right?! This scene is absolutely epic! One of the coolest things about it is how it captures this massive emotional swing. Like, one minute everything seems hopeless - you've got Théoden looking all defeated and Merry thinking they're "too late," and then BOOM!\n\nCheck out this transformation:\n1. First Théoden's all "cowed by age," looking beaten\n2. Then there's this amazing moment with the wind changing and light breaking through\n3. And suddenly he's like a completely different person, standing "tall and proud"\n\nAnd that speech! "Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!" It's got this amazing poetic rhythm to it that just gets you pumped up.\n\nPlus, that detail about him blowing the horn so hard it literally breaks?

So we've got this epic scene with Théoden and the Rohirrim in front of us - honestly one of the most goosebump-inducing moments in literature! \n\nThe scene starts with this really tense buildup where everyone's basically holding their breath. Théoden looks defeated and old, Merry's feeling the weight of dread, and it seems like all hope is lost... but then BAM! Everything changes with a blast of horns and one of the most famous battle speeches ever.\n\nWant to dig into any part of it? We could talk about:\n- How Théoden transforms from looking "cowed by age" to "tall and proud"\n- That incredible battle cry ("Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!")\n- The way the author builds tension\n- The horn-blowing moment that literally bursts the horn apart\n\nWhat catches your eye about this scene?	2025-01-07 03:06:45.829989	null	0

The mind and will of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet, no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\n\nAfter a while, the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still, they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last, he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish or dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them. But at that same moment, there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second, it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound, the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups, he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\n"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!"\n\nWith that, he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway, all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.\n\n"Ride now, ride now!

The exact quote is: "he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder." \n\nLike, Théoden is SO HYPED in this moment that he literally blows the horn until it BREAKS. Not just a little toot - mans is out here destroying musical instruments with pure intensity! 😂\n\nAnd what makes it even better is that after he shatters his horn, all the other horns join in and it's described as being "like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains." So you've got this guy who just went from looking old and defeated to being so fired up he's breaking horns and starting what sounds like a whole medieval metal concert.\n\nIt's such a perfect detail to show just how completely Théoden has transformed from his earlier defeated state into this absolute warrior king mode.

271e04eb-26d6-46e8-ad3d-beeae148d2af	\N	assistant	Hello! I see we're looking at a powerful passage from what appears to be "The Lord of the Rings," specifically the famous "Ride of the Rohirrim" scene. This is a pivotal moment where King Théoden and the Riders of Rohan arrive to aid Minas Tirith during its siege.\n\nThe passage is structured in three distinct emotional phases:\n1. Initial approach - cautious and silent\n2. Moment of doubt and heaviness\n3. Dramatic transformation and rally to battle\n\nWould you like to explore any particular aspect of this passage? We could discuss:\n- The powerful imagery and symbolism\n- The emotional journey of the characters\n- The literary techniques used\n- The significance of this moment in the larger story\n- The specific language and word choices that make it so impactful\n\nWhat interests you most about this scene?	2025-01-07 03:06:28.839899	null	0

33055e84-29dd-4404-a14f-8fd0ee6c1013	\N	assistant	This flash appears to be a significant moment that marks a turning point in the scene. From the context, it's likely one of two things:\n\n1. A military/siege event: Given that the city is under attack (we know there are "fires of the siege" mentioned earlier), this could be some kind of weapon or destructive force being used against Minas Tirith by the enemy forces.\n\n2. A symbolic/pivotal moment: The description is written with particularly dramatic imagery - "lightning had sprung from the earth" and the city standing "dazzling far off in black and white" with its tower like a "glittering needle." This moment immediately precedes Théoden's transformation from his doubting, shrunken state to his heroic rally.\n\nThe text follows this flash with "a great boom," suggesting it was likely some kind of attack or explosive force against the city. This moment serves both as a literal military event and a literary device - it's the catalyst that spurs Théoden into action and marks the transition from hesitation to the famous charge of the Rohirrim.\n\nThe specific imagery used - the city briefly illuminated in stark black and white with its tower like a needle - creates a moment of clarity and definition that cuts through the previous atmosphere of doubt and darkness.	2025-01-07 03:08:16.615066	null	0

Looking at the full document now, I can see that the actual final line is:\n\n"and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City."\n\nThis comes at the end of a much longer passage that describes the entire charge, including how Théoden rode at the front, how he appeared like "a god of old," and how the entire host of Rohan burst into song as they fought. The ending is quite powerful, describing how their battle-song was both "fair and terrible" and reached all the way to Minas Tirith.\n\nI apologize for my earlier mistake and thank you for the prompting to look more carefully at the complete text.	2025-01-08 00:31:22.476794	null	0

While not explicitly stated, based on the broader context of The Lord of the Rings, this is probably from siege weapons or dark magic being used against the city during the battle.\n\nThe description is particularly interesting because it reverses the normal direction we expect lightning - instead of coming from the sky down, this flash springs "from the earth beneath the City." This unnatural direction emphasizes that this is not natural lightning but rather something sinister and destructive.\n\nThis moment is also significant because it serves as a turning point in the scene - right after this flash and the subsequent boom, Théoden transforms from his hesitant, shrinking state into his bold, warrior-king mode, leading the charge of the Rohirrim.\n\nThe author (Tolkien) deliberately places this flash at a pivotal moment, using it both as:\n1. A representation of the city's peril\n2. The catalyst that spurs Théoden into action\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?	2025-01-07 03:13:11.560573	null	0

The text earlier mentions "the fires of the siege" and there's "a smell of burning was in the air," indicating the city is under heavy attack.\n\nThink of it like medieval fantasy siege warfare cranked up to 11 - Sauron's forces aren't just using normal catapults and battering rams, but likely massive, magically-enhanced weapons. In the broader story, they have things like:\n- Grond (a huge magical battering ram)\n- Catapults throwing not just rocks but chunks of masonry from destroyed buildings and other terrible ammunition\n- Dark sorcery from the Witch-king (the "Black Captain" mentioned earlier)\n\nThe flash and following "great boom" are probably from one of these massive siege impacts or magical attacks. It's written to feel apocalyptic - like the city itself is being torn apart from below, which makes sense given that Sauron's forces are trying to completely destroy Minas Tirith, not just capture it.	2025-01-07 03:13:54.932457	null	0

Transformation and Revival:\n- The horn blast marks the dramatic transformation of Théoden from a seemingly "cowed by age" leader to one who stands "tall and proud"\n- The text explicitly shows this shift: "At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect"\n\n2. Breaking of Despair:\n- Prior to the horns, the passage is heavy with despair and doubt ("Time seemed poised in uncertainty" and "Too late was worse than never!")\n- The horn blast literally "burst asunder," symbolically breaking through this despair just as dawn breaks through the clouds in the South\n\n3. Natural Force Imagery:\n- The horns are described as "like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains"\n- This natural imagery suggests primal, unstoppable force that matches the earlier metaphor of the Rohirrim as a "rising tide"\n\n4. Rally and Unity:\n- The initial horn blast triggers all other horns to join "in music," representing the unified response of the Rohirrim to their king's call\n- This collective sound symbolizes the gathering of courage and shared purpose\n\n5. Declaration of Presence:\n- In a tactical sense, the horns announce the Rohirrim's presence to both friend and foe, marking the end of their silent approach and the beginning of their charge\n- This suggests a transition from stealth to open defiance\n\nThe horns thus serve as both a literal and metaphorical breaking point in the narrative, marking the moment when doubt turns to determination and when individual fear transforms into collective courage.	2025-01-07 03:22:16.266217	null	0

The only direct reference is in:\n\n1. The "EXPOSURES" section, which simply states "Household income adjusted for household size"\n2. The descriptive statistics showing "mean [SD] number of household members per person, 2.5 [1.3]"\n\nWithout more detailed information from other chunks of the paper, I cannot make definitive statements about:\n- The exact formula used for adjustment\n- Whether they used equivalence scales\n- How they handled changes in household composition over time\n- Whether different approaches were tested\n\nThis limitation in methodological detail means we can't fully assess how the household size adjustments might have impacted the findings. What we do know is that they recognized the importance of accounting for household size, as raw household income without such adjustments could be misleading (e.g., a higher household income supporting more people might not represent greater economic advantage).\n\nWould you like to check other chunks of the paper for more detailed methodological information about these adjustments?	2025-01-07 03:22:37.116069	null	0

Still they were unchallenged, and still Theoden gave\n\nno signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now\n\nnearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow\n\nof death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon\n\nSnowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas\n\nTirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\n\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as\n\nif a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His\n\nheart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They\n\nwere too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps\n\nTheoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to\n\nhide in the hills.\n\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a\n\nchange. Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far\n\naway, in the South the clouds could be dimly seen as remote\n\ngrey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.\n\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning\n\nhad sprung from the earth beneath the City. For a searing\n\nsecond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost\n\ntower like a glittering needle; and then as the darkness closed\n\nagain there came rolling over the fields a great boom.\n\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly\n\nerect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his\n\nstirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there\n\nhad ever heard a mortal man achieve before:\n\nArise, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!\n\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,\n\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!\n\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!\n\nWith that he seized a great horn from Guthlaf his banner-\n\nbearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder.\n\nAnd straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in\n\nmusic, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour\n\nwas like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the\n\nmountains.\n\nRide now, ride now!

22f053ac-af83-4907-8ce5-ae21f100d668	\N	assistant	In the poem, the speaker's pause to watch the woods fill with snow represents a moment of contemplation and temporary escape from daily responsibilities. The poem doesn't explicitly state why he watches, but several contextual clues suggest deeper meanings:\n\n1. The setting is significant: It's "the darkest evening of the year," suggesting a time of solitude and reflection.\n\n2. The woods are described as "lovely, dark and deep," indicating their allure and mysterious nature that draws the speaker in.\n\n3. The act of stopping itself is unusual, as emphasized by his horse's reaction who "must think it queer/To stop without a farmhouse near."\n\nThe watching seems to represent:\n- A desire for a peaceful moment of solitude\n- An appreciation of natural beauty\n- A brief respite from responsibilities (referenced later in "promises to keep")\n\nHowever, while he's drawn to this moment of quiet observation, he ultimately cannot stay, as indicated by the repeated final lines "And miles to go before I sleep." The act of watching the snow fall becomes a brief, meditative pause in an otherwise busy life filled with obligations.\n\nThe fact that these are someone else's woods ("Whose woods these are I think I know") and that the owner is away ("He will not see me stopping here") adds a slight element of trespassing or forbidden pleasure to this moment of observation.	2025-01-07 04:09:59.533731	null	0
297418d4-db1c-4a07-8040-b44f8df4b2e9	\N	assistant	The poem doesn't explicitly state what specific promises the speaker has to keep. This ambiguity appears intentional, as the "promises" likely represent broader life responsibilities and obligations rather than any single promise.\n\nThe line "But I have promises to keep" comes near the end of the poem, following the speaker's moment of enchantment with the "lovely, dark and deep" woods. The context suggests these promises could be:\n\n1. Practical responsibilities: Daily duties, work commitments, or somewhere he needs to be\n2. Social obligations: Commitments to family, friends, or community\n3. Personal responsibilities: Promises to himself or his life's goals\n\nThe repetition of "And miles to go before I sleep" (twice in the final stanza) reinforces that these promises are pressing and require him to continue his journey rather than lingering in the woods. The metaphorical "miles to go" suggests both:\n- Literal distance to travel\n- Figurative life journey and responsibilities ahead\n\nThe vagueness of "promises" makes the poem more universal - readers can relate it to their own obligations that pull them away from moments of peaceful contemplation.\n\nThe tension between the desire to stay and watch the woods and the need to fulfill one's promises is central to the poem's meaning.	2025-01-07 04:10:30.913667	null	0

Strategic Advantage:\n- Like water finding weakness in a dike, the Rohirrim are exploiting a gap in the enemy's defenses\n- The phrase "that men have thought secure" suggests the enemy's overconfidence and false sense of security\n- This is explicitly supported by the text noting that "the Black Captain" remains unaware of any flaw in his designs\n\n2. Movement Pattern:\n- The description "pouring in slowly but steadily" emphasizes:\n   * The methodical nature of their approach\n   * The unstoppable force of their advance\n   * The stealth and patience of their tactical approach\n\n3. Natural Force Imagery:\n- Like a tide, the Rohirrim represent:\n   * An overwhelming natural force\n   * An inevitable and unstoppable advance\n   * A power that can't be easily contained once it breaks through\n\n4. Element of Surprise:\n- The text supports this by noting they were "still unchallenged"\n- Like water breaching a dike, their attack will be sudden and devastating once fully unleashed\n\nThis imagery effectively foreshadows the eventual impact of the Rohirrim's charge while emphasizing both their tactical advantage and the enemy's vulnerability.	2025-01-08 00:48:20.021373	null	0

Those cash payments are usually made in the form of periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures. In the absence of credit risk (the risk of default), the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of your required return based on your inflation expectations. This article breaks down bond pricing, defines the term "bond yield," and demonstrates how inflation expectations and interest rates determine the value of a bond.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ●Bonds are subject to interest rate risk since rising rates will result in falling prices (and vice-versa). ●Interest rates respond to inflation: when prices in an economy rise, the central bank typically raises its target rate to cool down an overheating economy. ●Inflation also erodes the real value of a bond's face value, which is a particular concern for longer maturity debts. ●Because of these linkages, bond prices are quite sensitive to changes in inflation and inflation forecasts. Measures of Risk There are two primary risks that must be assessed when investing in bonds: interest rate risk and credit risk. Though our focus is on how interest rates affect bond pricing (otherwise known as interest rate risk), a bond investor must also be aware of credit risk.\n\nAt the July 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed announced it was raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%, moving its target range to 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed expects to continue raising rates in order to bring down inflation. As a result, the 10-year Treasury is hovering roughly around 4%. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways, which we'll discuss below. Credit risk, meanwhile, is the risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments.

Kip Viscusi, published by Oxford University Press in 1992.\n\nThis appears to be an academic work that will explore the complex relationships and decisions involving risk management between public and private sectors. The title "Fatal Tradeoffs" suggests it will examine serious or life-and-death decisions regarding risk assessment and management.\n\nWithout seeing more content, I can only note that:\n1. The author, W. Kip Viscusi, is a known scholar in the field of risk analysis and regulation\n2. The publication by Oxford University Press indicates this is a scholarly work\n3.

Early 1990s marked a period of significant regulatory development and debate about risk management\n2. This was shortly after major disasters like Chernobyl (1986) and Exxon Valdez (1989) that reshaped thinking about risk\n3. The era represented a transition point in public-private sector relationships, with increasing privatization and deregulation trends\n\nContemporary Relevance:\n1. While some specific examples or data may be dated, the fundamental questions about how to balance public and private risk responsibilities remain relevant\n2. The book likely predates many modern risk challenges (cyber risks, climate change impacts, global pandemic responses)\n3. Reading this work allows us to see how risk management thinking has evolved over the past 30 years\n\nAnalytical Value:\n1. The book can serve as a baseline for understanding how risk management approaches have changed\n2. It might help identify which principles of risk management have remained constant versus those that have evolved\n3. The theoretical frameworks presented may still be applicable even if specific examples are dated\n\nTo fully assess the temporal context and current relevance, we would need to examine the specific arguments and examples presented in the book's content.

Here's what's wrong:\n\n1. We're inconsistent:\n- We panic about some risks while completely ignoring others\n- We worry too much about rare but scary things (like terrorism or cancer-causing chemicals)\n- We don't pay enough attention to everyday risks we choose to take (like driving or poor diet)\n\n2. The decision-making is messy because:\n- We have three different groups making decisions: individuals, companies, and government\n- People don't have enough good information to make smart choices\n- The media can blow some risks out of proportion, affecting how people view dangers\n\n3. The current approach is wasteful because:\n- We can't eliminate all risk from life\n- We spend too much money on small risks\n- We ignore some big risks that could be fixed more easily\n- We're so scared of small risks that we might block new technologies that could actually make life better and safer\n\n4. We're focusing on the wrong things:\n- Too much attention on equipment and processes\n- Not enough attention on human mistakes and bad behavior\n- Too much focus on political hot topics rather than real dangers\n\nThe author suggests we need to completely rethink how we manage risks, or we'll keep wasting money and not getting the best results for public safety.\n\nThink of it like this: It's as if we're spending a fortune on lightning rods (rare risk) while ignoring the fact that we're not wearing seatbelts (common risk) - we need to be smarter about where we put our effort and money.	2025-01-08 01:24:04.364582	null	1

Problems with Human Risk Assessment:\n- People struggle to understand very small probabilities (like differentiating between 10⁻⁷ and 10⁻⁵)\n- We tend to overestimate low-probability events (like tornados)\n- We underestimate higher-probability risks (like heart disease)\n- We overreact to dramatic or visible events (like Three Mile Island)\n\n2. Expected Utility Theory:\n- The author suggests using "expected utility theory" as the basis for making risk decisions\n- While people don't always follow this theory in practice, its basic principles make sense\n- There's no better alternative theory for making decisions under uncertainty\n\n3. Ideal Policy Making:\n- We should imagine what perfect market processes would look like\n- Consider questions like: What level of pharmaceutical side effects would be acceptable if we had perfect information?\n- Think about future generations and environmental decisions\n\n4. Real-World Examples:\n- The greenhouse effect ranks 23rd in public environmental concerns despite being a top EPA priority\n- Car accidents kill 1 in 5,000 Americans yearly, yet people often focus on less likely risks\n- Public reaction to events like Three Mile Island shows how emotion can override rational risk assessment\n\nThe text suggests we need a more rational, systematic approach to risk management, rather than letting our natural biases and emotional reactions guide policy.

W. Kip Viscusi is essentially saying, "Hey, we've got a really mixed-up way of handling danger in our world."\n\nThink of it this way: We're like someone who installs an expensive security system to protect against an unlikely break-in but then drives to work every day without a seatbelt. We get super worried about rare things (like terrorist attacks or obscure chemicals) while shrugging off the everyday risks that are actually more likely to harm us (like poor diet or texting while driving).\n\nAbout Expected Utility Theory:\nYes, this appears to be central to his argument. It's like a rational framework for making decisions - imagine if we could all be perfectly logical about risks and rewards. While Viscusi acknowledges that people don't naturally think this way, he suggests it's the best tool we have for making smart decisions about risk.\n\nThe Big Problem:\nWe have three different "parents" trying to protect us:\n- Individual people\n- Companies\n- Government\n\nAnd they're all working with:\n- Incomplete information\n- Media that sometimes blows things out of proportion\n- People's emotional reactions rather than logical ones\n\nIt's like having three different people trying to drive one car, each with a different map, and none of them quite sure where they're going!\n\nThe author's message is essentially: "Let's stop being paranoid about the unlikely stuff and start being smart about the real dangers we face every day." He's calling for a complete rethink of how we handle risk as a society.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any part of this story-style explanation?	2025-01-08 01:30:25.102572	null	1
861f3c3d-2ffb-44e2-9d56-9bce4446f239	bfa4e572-4e4f-4be4-b8d5-11df754aa58a	assistant	Let me continue the story...\n\nSo remember how we talked about society being like an overprotective but confused parent? Well, Viscusi gives us some really interesting examples of just how mixed up we are about danger:\n\nPicture this: We're like someone who's terrified of tornadoes (a rare event) but doesn't take their blood pressure medication seriously (a much bigger risk). The author points out that humans are pretty terrible at understanding really tiny numbers - like, we can't really feel the difference between a one-in-a-million chance and a one-in-ten-thousand chance, even though that's huge!\n\nHere's a fascinating real-world example he shares: The greenhouse effect (what we now call climate change) was ranked way down at #23 on people's environmental worry list, even though the EPA considered it a top priority. It's like we're watching the wrong end of the pool while someone's drowning at the other end!\n\nAnd get this - car accidents kill about 1 in 5,000 Americans every year (that's a lot!), but we're often more scared of things that are way less likely to harm us. It's like being more afraid of shark attacks than crossing the street.\n\nThe Solution He Proposes:\nViscusi suggests we need to use something called "Expected Utility Theory." Think of it as a fancy way of saying "let's be logical about this." It's like having a clear-headed friend who helps you make decisions by looking at the actual odds and consequences, not just your gut feelings.\n\nHe wants us to imagine a perfect world where:\n- Everyone has complete information\n- Future generations get a say in today's decisions\n- We make choices based on real risks, not dramatic headlines\n\nIt's like he's saying, "Before we spend a fortune childproofing the house, let's figure out what actually keeps kids safe."\n\nThe big takeaway? Our fear-driven, headline-chasing approach to risk is costing us money AND making us less safe. We need to get smarter about how we handle danger, or as Viscusi puts it, we'll keep "paying more than we should for health gains that are less than we could achieve."\n\nWould you like me to unpack any part of this further?	2025-01-08 01:31:30.249645	null	2

It's like when there's one shark attack at a beach, and suddenly everyone's afraid to go swimming... for years! We have this tendency to overreact to big, scary, visible events while ignoring the quiet, everyday dangers that are actually more likely to harm us.\n\nHere's where it gets really interesting - Viscusi points out that our mistakes in judging risk come in two flavors:\n\n1. The "Boy Who Cried Wolf" in Reverse:\n- When risks are really small (like getting struck by lightning), we actually overestimate them\n- But when risks are bigger and more common (like heart disease), we tend to shrug them off\n- It's like we're more afraid of monsters under the bed than the very real stairs we might slip on\n\n2. The "Death by a Thousand Cuts" Problem:\n- Each little decision we make about risk might seem unimportant on its own\n- But add them all up, and they make a huge difference\n- It's like saying "one cookie won't hurt" every single day - eventually, it adds up!\n\nThe Perfect World Dream:\nViscusi suggests we should imagine what would happen if we could make perfectly rational decisions. Like:\n- What if we knew exactly how risky a new medicine was before taking it?\n- What if our great-grandchildren could "vote" on our environmental decisions today?\n- What if we could put aside our fears and look at the actual numbers?\n\nThe Big Problem He's Pointing Out:\nWe're stuck in this cycle where:\n- Something scary happens\n- Media covers it extensively\n- People panic\n- Resources get thrown at that specific problem\n- Meanwhile, bigger but less dramatic risks continue unchecked\n\nIt's like spending all our money on asteroid insurance while smoking two packs a day - we're focused on the wrong things!\n\nWant to explore any part of this further? There's plenty more to unpack about how we could actually fix these problems!	2025-01-08 01:32:07.64047	null	2

Consider his specific example of the greenhouse effect (now climate change): despite being a top EPA priority, it ranked 23rd in public environmental concerns. This disconnect perfectly demonstrates how we struggle with abstract, long-term risks versus immediate, tangible threats.\n\nThe automobile fatality statistic he cites is particularly telling: 1 in 5,000 Americans die in car accidents annually. Yet we often fixate on far less probable risks. This isn't just casual observation - it's backed by systematic research showing we overestimate low-probability events while underestimating higher-probability ones.\n\nThe Three Mile Island incident serves as a perfect case study of our risk perception biases. While the actual health impacts were minimal, the incident fundamentally altered nuclear policy and public perception. It exemplifies what Viscusi calls our tendency to dramatically recalibrate risk assessment after high-profile events.\n\nHis proposed framework, Expected Utility Theory, isn't just about being logical - it's about creating a systematic approach to evaluate tradeoffs. Imagine applying this to pharmaceutical development: instead of responding to public panic over rare side effects, we'd weigh the statistical benefits against quantifiable risks.\n\nThe core irony Viscusi exposes is that our current approach isn't just irrational - it's expensive and ineffective. We're simultaneously over-investing in some areas while leaving significant, manageable risks unaddressed.\n\nShould we explore how this framework might apply to contemporary risk management challenges?	2025-01-08 01:33:44.980317	null	2
08cfc34d-83be-4616-afc5-e637597de4fa	bfa4e572-4e4f-4be4-b8d5-11df754aa58a	assistant	Let me break down these new sections while keeping it precise but engaging:\n\nViscusi delves into the fascinating psychology of how we mess up risk assessment in two key ways:\n\n1. The Numbers Game\nHe provides a brilliant concrete example: scientists themselves struggle to grasp the difference between a 10⁻⁷ and 10⁻⁵ risk - that's a hundredfold difference! It's like having trouble distinguishing between paying $1 versus $100 for the same item. These small probability mistakes might seem trivial in isolation, but they compound dramatically.\n\n2. The Status Quo Bias\nHere's where it gets particularly interesting: Viscusi introduces what he calls the "Russian roulette problem." People will actually pay more to remove a single bullet from a gun with one bullet than to remove one bullet from a gun with three bullets - even though the latter situation is objectively more dangerous. This completely defies economic logic, but illustrates how we irrationally value certainty over probability.\n\nHe then brings this into real-world context with the Chilean grape scare. When two grapes were found contaminated with cyanide in Philadelphia, people couldn't rationally assess the actual risk. Instead, their decisions were driven by potential regret and social norms - similar to why we won't leave a baby alone for even ten minutes, despite statistically greater risks elsewhere.\n\nThe Imbalance in Action:\n- We obsess over man-made carcinogens while being relatively blasé about natural ones\n- New technologies face stricter regulation than familiar risks\n- We overvalue complete elimination of a risk versus significant reduction\n\nWould you like to explore any of these specific examples further, or shall we delve into how these biases affect policy-making?	2025-01-08 01:34:24.498871	null	3
b4aa7b68-64fa-462d-8311-cd4434ad082f	bfa4e572-4e4f-4be4-b8d5-11df754aa58a	assistant	Looking at the text's deeper implications about risk perception:\n\nThe Environmental Disconnect\nThat greenhouse effect ranking (23rd in public concerns) becomes even more striking when paired with the 1988 heat wave example. Viscusi points out how we struggle with interpreting warning signs - they're "seldom as informative as canaries in the coal mine." We want clear signals, but reality rarely obliges. The San Francisco earthquake of 1989 gets mentioned as a stark reminder: some risks strike without any warning at all.\n\nThe Money-Risk Paradox\nThere's a certain dark irony in how this plays out economically. Our heightened fear of new risks versus familiar ones leads to a perverse outcome: we end up paying more money for products while actually exposing ourselves to greater risks. It's a lose-lose situation driven by our own biases.\n\nThe Control Illusion\nViscusi makes a particularly sharp observation about automobile fatalities. Despite the stark statistics (1 in 5,000 Americans dying yearly), our response is muted because we believe we have control. He suggests that if drivers had "a more realistic sense of what they can and cannot do to control the risk," we might see more seatbelt use and less drunk driving.\n\nThe Regret Factor\nPerhaps most fascinating is how regret shapes decision-making, especially when faced with ambiguous risks. It's not just about probability - it's about how we'll feel about our choices in hindsight. This explains why certain precautions that seem statistically irrational (like the baby-sitting example) feel intuitively correct.\n\nThis sets up a fundamental challenge: How do we design policies that acknowledge these very human reactions while still pursuing rational risk management?	2025-01-08 01:36:39.876198	null	3
2f6712b3-c711-4399-80ec-e028786202df	bfa4e572-4e4f-4be4-b8d5-11df754aa58a	assistant	Looking at the next section, Viscusi drives deeper into how these psychological quirks manifest in real policy and behavior:\n\nThe Reference Point Problem\nThere's this fascinating bias where we get fixated on changes from our current situation, rather than absolute risk levels. Think about how differently we react to a "new" versus "old" technology, even when the newer one might be safer. This isn't just individual psychology - it actually shapes government policy, leading to stricter regulations on new technologies while grandfathering in riskier old ones.\n\nThe Natural vs. Artificial Paradox\nHere's a particularly sharp observation: We scrutinize man-made carcinogens with incredible intensity while being relatively casual about natural ones that might pose greater risks. This isn't just inconsistent - it's expensive. As Viscusi notes, "Because of this imbalance, we pay more dollars for our products and end up with greater risks to our lives." It's a perfect example of how irrational fear can create lose-lose situations.\n\nThe Certainty Premium\nThe Russian Roulette example is particularly illuminating - it shows how we'll pay more to completely eliminate a risk than to reduce a larger risk. From a pure expected utility standpoint, this makes no sense. You should pay more to remove one bullet from a three-bullet scenario than a one-bullet scenario (since in the first case, you might still die and money becomes worthless). Yet people consistently do the opposite.\n\nThe Forest Fires vs. Forest Management Dilemma\nViscusi makes a pointed observation about reactive versus proactive policy: "Forest management efforts should not have to await the chance burning of national parks and forests." It's a perfect metaphor for how we often wait for disasters before taking action on obvious risks.\n\nThis section really highlights how our psychological quirks don't just influence individual decisions - they become baked into institutional policies and regulations, often with counterproductive results.	2025-01-08 01:37:22.295888	null	3

Let's break down these crucial insights:\n\nThe Agency Problem\nViscusi presents a fascinating dilemma using the FDA as a case study. Imagine a drug with a 1/10,000 chance of thalidomide-level side effects, but significant benefits. Logically, this might be worth the risk, especially since we could withdraw it if problems arise. But the FDA, acting as society's agent, likely wouldn't approve it. Why? Because they're structurally biased against new risks, even when taking no action might cause more harm.\n\nThe Information Asymmetry Trap\nThere's a clever observation about visible versus invisible costs:\n- We can easily see and count the victims of an approved dangerous drug\n- We can't easily measure or identify people who died because a beneficial drug was never approved\n- This creates a perverse incentive structure favoring inaction\n\nThe Reassurance Paradox\nViscusi points out something counterintuitive: sometimes the mere perception of safety is as valuable as actual safety. When federal agencies show zero tolerance for risk, it provides psychological comfort - even if this stance leads to worse overall outcomes. The appearance of protection becomes a good in itself.\n\nThe Reform Options\nHe lays out four possible paths forward, each with its own problems:\n1. More government decision-making (but can they assess risks better?)\n2. Shifting authority to experts (but will they share public priorities?)\n3. Creating collaborative decision processes (but will they achieve consensus?)\n4. Improving individual decision-making through expert-certified information (like financial auditing)\n\nThis section really highlights the institutional complexity of risk management - it's not just about calculating odds, but about managing perception, accountability, and competing interests.	2025-01-08 01:39:37.971544	null	4

The text presents a nuanced view, but let me break down these specific points:\n\nOn FDA Strictness:\nViscusi appears to be critical of the FDA's extreme risk aversion, but acknowledges it's complicated:\n\nCONS of FDA strictness:\n- Blocks potentially beneficial drugs (uses AIDS medications as example)\n- Creates asymmetric errors favoring inaction over action\n- May result in more net harm through "errors of omission"\n\nPROS of FDA strictness:\n- Provides public reassurance value\n- Creates trust in government oversight\n- Prevents visible disasters that could undermine faith in the system\n\nThe text suggests this is a genuine trade-off, not a clear right/wrong. As Viscusi notes: "that reassurance alone enhances individual welfare" but also points out that this might be "more damaging than the risks themselves."\n\nRegarding Option 4 (Individual Decision-Making):\nWhile the text doesn't explicitly mention equity issues (good catch - that's an important consideration you've identified), it does highlight some problems:\n- Relies on "expert-certified information"\n- Compares it to financial auditing (which, as you suggest, implies a system that works better for those with resources and education)\n- Doesn't address how to make this information accessible or comprehensible to all\n\nThe article suggests this approach might help but doesn't fully address implementation challenges or equity concerns. Instead, it presents it as one of several imperfect solutions to a complex problem.\n\nSo in essence, Viscusi isn't definitely saying FDA strictness is good or bad - he's highlighting how institutional incentives and psychological factors create a system that might be politically stable but not necessarily optimal for public health.	2025-01-08 01:42:39.39968	null	4

He outlines several approaches, each with significant drawbacks:\n\n1. The Government Solution:\n- Could shift more decisions to government agencies\n- But there's a critical problem: governments might be no better at calculating risks accurately\n- Even with good information, they might still make poor decisions\n\n2. The Expert Solution:\n- Transfer decision-making to those most qualified\n- But introduces a new problem: experts' preferences might not align with those affected\n- Creates potential disconnect between expertise and public interest\n\n3. The Collaborative Approach:\n- Create processes where both agents (experts/government) and principals (public) participate\n- But Viscusi is skeptical about achieving consensus\n- Notes "little evidence that such processes would produce convergence"\n\n4. The Information Solution:\n- Improve individual decision-making through expert-certified information\n- Similar to how accounting firms verify financial data\n- But doesn't address underlying behavioral biases\n\nThe Saccharin and AIDS Examples\nHe uses these cases to illustrate when public pressure can force flexibility in typically rigid systems. It's particularly interesting because it shows how affected populations (like AIDS patients) might rationally prefer higher risks than regulatory bodies are comfortable allowing.\n\nThe key tension running through all of this: How do we balance expertise, public preference, and institutional constraints in a way that produces better outcomes while maintaining public trust?	2025-01-08 01:43:15.92044	null	4

The solutions he presents reveal complex trade-offs:\n\nAgency vs. Autonomy\n- Government agencies might make more "rational" decisions\n- But they face their own biases and institutional constraints\n- Plus, they might not reflect the values or preferences of those affected (as in the AIDS case)\n\nThe Information Quality Problem\nThere's a parallel drawn with financial markets through the accounting firm comparison. But risk information is fundamentally different from financial data:\n- Financial data can be audited against concrete records\n- Risk assessments often involve uncertain futures\n- Complex probabilities are harder to communicate than dollar amounts\n\nThe Pressure Point Paradox\nThe text notes how "potential beneficiaries" (AIDS patients, saccharin users) sometimes successfully pressure for regulatory flexibility. This suggests that:\n- Regulatory systems can adapt when pressure is strong enough\n- But this might favor well-organized or visible groups\n- Raises questions about equity in risk regulation\n\nThe broader question becomes: How do we design systems that can:\n1. Protect against clear dangers\n2. Remain flexible for special cases\n3. Maintain public trust\n4. Account for different risk preferences among different groups\n\nThis is especially relevant given that risks often affect different populations differently, yet we typically regulate them uniformly.	2025-01-08 01:44:55.320956	null	4

While we can verify financial data, risk information is fundamentally different because:\n1. Future probabilities can't be "audited" like past transactions\n2. Different experts might legitimately disagree about risk levels\n3. The same risk might mean different things to different populations\n\nThe Practical Framework\nViscusi suggests we need processes that can:\n- Allow for expert input without giving experts complete control\n- Consider public preferences without being paralyzed by misconceptions\n- Remain flexible enough to handle special cases (like the AIDS example) while maintaining consistent standards\n\nBut here's where it gets particularly challenging: How do you create transparency and accountability in a system dealing with such complex probabilities and trade-offs? The FDA example shows how visible failures (approved drugs that cause harm) get more attention than invisible ones (beneficial drugs never approved), creating skewed incentives.\n\nThis suggests that any effective risk management system needs to somehow account for:\n- Both action and inaction costs\n- Different risk preferences among affected populations\n- The need to maintain public trust while sometimes making unpopular decisions\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these aspects?	2025-01-08 01:45:51.230178	null	4

Viscusi mentions it in the context of FDA drug approval, where "AIDS victims sometimes put substantial pressure on the FDA to compromise normally stringent procedures for approving... drugs."\n\nHere's the underlying risk trade-off:\n- Traditional FDA process: Very cautious, extensive testing, long approval times\n- AIDS patients' perspective: Willing to accept higher risks of drug side effects or uncertain outcomes because:\n  1. They faced a terminal illness\n  2. Time waiting for full FDA approval meant deaths\n  3. Even partially effective or risky treatments might be better than no treatment\n\nThis represents a case where the people affected by the risk (AIDS patients) had very different risk preferences than the regulatory agency (FDA). For them, the risk of drug side effects was less threatening than the certainty of disease progression.\n\nThis example challenges the "agency dilemma" Viscusi discusses: Should the FDA (the agent) maintain its ultra-cautious approach when the principals (AIDS patients) explicitly want to take greater risks? It illustrates how one-size-fits-all risk regulation might not serve all populations equally, especially when:\n- Time is a critical factor\n- The alternative to the risk is worse\n- The affected population is well-informed and actively advocating for their preferences\n\nThis case became influential in debates about FDA approval processes and patient autonomy in medical decisions.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on how this example connects to Viscusi's broader arguments about risk regulation?	2025-01-08 01:44:16.594886	null	4

This excerpt describes the pivotal moment when King Théoden and the Rohirrim prepare to charge to Minas Tirith's aid.\n\nThe passage has several key elements:\n\n1. Setting and Atmosphere:\n- The scene takes place on the fields of Gondor\n- There's a dark, oppressive mood ("smell of burning," "shadow of death")\n- The passage moves from darkness to the first hints of dawn\n\n2. Psychological Journey:\n- Initially shows Théoden seeming weak and hesitant ("shrink down, cowed by age")\n- Transforms into a moment of magnificent courage and leadership\n- Even Merry experiences this tension ("horror and doubt had settled on him")\n\n3. The Turning Point:\n- Marked by environmental changes ("Wind was in his face! Light was glimmering")\n- Culminates in Théoden's famous battle cry\n- Ends with the dramatic horn-blowing sequence\n\nWould you like to explore any of these aspects in more detail?	2025-01-08 02:31:52.380773	null	0

6613cf00-71f3-417d-a1b9-e2691b32b965	\N	assistant	Based on the document content, here are several key strategies to mitigate interest rate risk in a bond portfolio:\n\n1. Diversification Across Maturities:\n- The document explains that bonds with different maturities react differently to interest rate changes. As stated in the section "The Timing of a Bond's Cash Flows and Interest Rates," bonds with longer cash flows are more sensitive to interest rate changes, seeing their yields rise and prices fall more dramatically.\n\n2. Use of TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities):\n- The document specifically mentions that "Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) can be an effective way to offset inflation risk while providing a real rate of return guaranteed by the U.S. government." This provides direct protection against inflation risk, which is described as "a bond's worst enemy."\n\n3. Understanding Duration:\n- The document references "duration" as an "important bond metric" that measures price change relative to interest rate changes. Investors can use this metric to manage their portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate movements.\n\n4. Portfolio Diversification Beyond Bonds:\n- In the section "How Can Investors Safeguard Their Portfolios Against Interest Rate and Inflation Fluctuations?" the document recommends diversifying portfolios to include:\n  - Stocks\n  - Commodities\n  - Inflation-protected securities\n\n5. Monitor Yield Curve Movements:\n- The document emphasizes the importance of understanding where bonds lie on the yield curve (short end or long end) and the dynamics between short-term and long-term interest rates. This knowledge can help investors adjust their portfolio composition based on market conditions.\n\n6. Professional Guidance:\n- The document suggests "discussing this investment decision with your financial advisor" for specific strategies related to hedging against high or increasing interest rates.\n\nThe key is to understand that different bonds react differently to interest rate changes based on their maturity and position on the yield curve, and to use this understanding to create a balanced portfolio that can weather various interest rate environments.	2025-01-08 02:33:08.24092	null	0

Here are the key complaints from this section:\n\n1. Creation of bureaucratic burden:\n- "He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people"\n\n2. Military-related grievances:\n- Keeping standing armies during peacetime without colonial consent\n- Making military power superior to civilian authority\n- Quartering troops among the colonists\n- Protecting troops from punishment for murders through "mock trials"\n\n3. Economic and trade restrictions:\n- Cutting off trade with other parts of the world\n- Imposing taxes without colonial consent\n\n4. Legal system interference:\n- Depriving colonists of trial by jury in many cases\n- Transporting colonists overseas for trials\n- Abolishing English laws in neighboring province\n- Establishing arbitrary government\n\n5. Governmental interference:\n- Taking away colonial charters\n- Abolishing valuable laws\n- Fundamentally altering forms of government\n- Suspending colonial legislatures\n\nThe section demonstrates an escalating pattern of complaints, showing how the King systematically undermined colonial self-governance, legal rights, and economic freedoms. These grievances build upon earlier complaints in the document and help justify the colonies' decision to seek independence.	2025-01-08 02:34:37.72353	null	0

It's the culmination of the scene where the Riders of Rohan have transformed from their initially hesitant approach to a full, triumphant charge against the forces of Mordor.	2025-01-08 07:07:49.167336	null	0

Random Variables:\n- Introduction to discrete and continuous random variables\n- Explanation of probability mass functions (PMF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF)\n- Introduction to indicator random variables\n\n2. Important Discrete Probability Distributions:\n- Binomial distribution (number of successes in n independent trials)\n- Geometric distribution (trials until first success)\n- Hypergeometric distribution (sampling without replacement)\n- Poisson distribution (limit of binomial with large n and small p)\n\n3. Continuous Probability Distributions:\n- Uniform distribution U[a,b]\n- Exponential distribution\n- Normal distribution (with mean μ and standard deviation σ)\n\n4. Functions of Random Variables:\n- How to find the density of Y = ax + b when X has a known density\n- Transformation method using CDFs\n\nThe lecture provides mathematical formulas and definitions for each of these concepts, moving from basic discrete probability concepts to more complex continuous distributions and transformations. It appears to be building on previous probability fundamentals while introducing more advanced probability concepts.	2025-01-08 22:28:28.221756	null	0

Aesthetic Appeal:\n- The pristine beauty of "woods fill up with snow"\n- The "lovely, dark and deep" quality that captivates the speaker\n\n2. Solitude and Contemplation:\n- The speaker stops at a secluded spot "without a farmhouse near"\n- It's "the darkest evening of the year," suggesting a moment of profound isolation\n- The only sounds are the "harness bells," "easy wind and downy flake"\n\n3. Psychological Pull:\n- There's a tension between duty ("promises to keep") and desire (stopping to watch)\n- The woods seem to represent an escape or alternative to life's obligations\n- The repetition of "And miles to go before I sleep" suggests reluctance to leave\n\nThe act of "stopping" becomes a symbolic moment where the speaker briefly chooses personal contemplation over social obligations, though they ultimately acknowledge they must continue their journey. It's a momentary surrender to beauty and tranquility in the midst of life's demands.\n\nThis pause is made more poignant because it's clearly against practical considerations:\n- The owner is absent\n- The horse is puzzled\n- The speaker has commitments elsewhere\n\nThe "stopping" thus represents a small act of rebellion against routine and responsibility, though one that's ultimately temporary.	2025-01-08 22:34:55.092064	null	0

Technical Expertise & Responsibility:\nThe text specifically describes how Al is "one with his engine, every nerve listening for weaknesses, for the thumps or squeals, hums and chattering that indicate a change that may cause a breakdown." This shows his technical knowledge and the serious responsibility he feels as the driver and mechanic of the family.\n\n2. Deep Connection & Dedication:\nThe phrase "He had become the soul of the car" is particularly significant, suggesting Al has formed an almost spiritual connection with the vehicle. This isn't just about driving - it's about becoming completely in tune with their means of survival and progress.\n\n3. Anxiety & Concern:\nHis constant monitoring of the car ("his restless eyes jumping from the road to the instrument panel") and his worry about hills ahead reveals his awareness of the journey's challenges and his concern about the car's ability to make it to California.\n\n4. Family Role:\nWhen he asks Ma about hills ahead and worries about the load they're carrying, it shows he feels responsible for the family's successful migration. His practical concerns about having to "throw out some a' this stuff" demonstrate his focus on the practical necessities of survival.\n\nThis detailed characterization of Al's relationship with the car helps establish both the physical challenges of the journey and the psychological weight of responsibility on family members during this migration.	2025-01-09 00:40:22.978451	null	0

Technical Expertise & Responsibility:\n- The text describes Al as being "one with his engine, every nerve listening for weaknesses"\n- He's hyperaware of potential "thumps or squeals, hums and chattering that indicate a change"\n- This shows he's taken on the crucial responsibility of keeping the family's lifeline (the car) running\n\n2. Deep Connection & Dedication:\n- The phrase "He had become the soul of the car" suggests a spiritual-like connection between Al and the vehicle\n- This metaphysical union emphasizes how crucial the car is to their survival and journey\n\nThe dialogue about hills and climbing functions on multiple levels:\n\n1. Literal Concerns:\n- Al's worry about the "load we got" and potentially having to "throw out some a' this stuff" shows practical concerns\n- The conversation reveals their lack of knowledge about the journey ahead ("Seems to me they's hills")\n\n2. Symbolic Meaning:\n- The mention of "hills an' even mountains. Big ones" foreshadows the challenges ahead\n- Al's concern about climbing represents the family's broader anxieties about facing unknown obstacles\n- Ma's response about the preacher ("That preacher'll help us") suggests faith and community as resources for overcoming these challenges\n\nThe final exchange where Al asks Ma if she's "scared a goin' to a new place?" brings these elements together, showing how both practical concerns (the car's ability) and emotional fears (facing the unknown) are intertwined in their journey west. The conversation reveals both vulnerability and determination in facing their uncertain future.	2025-01-09 00:40:28.218241	null	0

Historical Setting (Early 16th Century):\n- This exchange of letters took place around 1514 between two powerful Muslim rulers:\n  * Ottoman Sultan Selim I (ruling from Constantinople/Istanbul)\n  * Safavid Shah Ismail I (ruling from Tabriz, Persia/modern Iran)\n\n2. Religious Conflict:\n- The core tension was religious and political. As the introduction explains, there was a fundamental split between:\n  * Sunni Islam (represented by the Ottomans)\n  * Shi'ite Islam (represented by the Safavids)\n- Shah Ismail claimed legitimacy through alleged descent from Muhammad's son-in-law 'Ali\n- This claim inherently challenged Ottoman authority\n\n3. Political Context:\n- The Safavids were gaining power to the east of Ottoman territories\n- Many people in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) were sympathetic to Shi'ite beliefs\n- This created internal security concerns for the Ottoman Empire\n- Sultan Selim responded with violence, "massacring many thousands in eastern Asia Minor"\n\n4. Style and Approach of Letters:\n- Selim's letter: Formal, religious, filled with Quranic quotations to establish legitimacy\n- Ismail's letter: More casual, even somewhat dismissive, using Persian poetry instead of religious references\n- These different styles reflect their different bases of authority:\n  * Selim relied on religious/legal arguments\n  * Ismail relied on hereditary claims\n\n5. Outcome:\nThe document notes that this exchange preceded the Battle of Chaldiran (1514), where Selim defeated Ismail but couldn't hold Tabriz due to its distance from Constantinople, resulting in a "stand-off."\n\nThis context helps explain why these letters are more than just diplomatic correspondence - they represent a fundamental clash of religious and political ideologies in the Islamic world of the 16th century.	2025-01-09 04:15:26.968143	null	0

I notice we're looking at a section from the Declaration of Independence, and the word "jurisdiction" is highlighted. This word appears in an important grievance against King George III, where the colonists are complaining about being subjected to "a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution."\n\nIn this context, "jurisdiction" refers to legal authority or power to govern. The colonists are specifically objecting to being placed under legal systems and authorities that they view as:\n1. Foreign to their constitutional rights as British subjects\n2. Unacknowledged by their own colonial laws\n\nWould you like to explore:\n- What specific jurisdictional issues the colonists were facing?\n- How this complaint connects to other grievances in this section?\n- The broader context of jurisdiction in colonial America?\n\nWhat interests you most about this topic?	2025-01-09 06:41:12.825724	null	1

Through the twentieth century in the United States and other\nhigh-income countries, growth in real incomes was accompanied by a\nhistorically unprecedented decline in mortality rates that caused life expectancy at\nbirth to grow by nearly 30 years.\nThe value of reductions in mortality risk can be roughly estimated from\n(admittedly heroic extrapolations of) differential wages in the labor market corre-\nsponding to differentials in the risk of death across occupations. Applying this\nmethodology, Nordhaus (2002, p. 35) has calculated that “to a first approximation,\nthe economic value of increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as\nlarge as the value of measured growth in nonhealth goods and services.” Falling\nmortality has also usually meant better health for the living, so that people are also\nliving better, healthier, and longer lives than did their forebears. Murphy and\nTopel (2005), who measure both the value of mortality decline and the benefits of\nbetter health for the living, estimate that, between 1970 and 2000, the annual value\nof increased longevity was about half of conventionally measured national income.\nImprovements in life expectancy in the United States have been matched by\nsimilar improvements in other rich countries.

This creates a "wage premium" for dangerous work. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Consider two similar jobs:\n- Job A: Office work with very low risk of death\n- Job B: Mining work with higher risk of death\n\n2. If Job B pays $10,000 more annually than Job A, economists interpret this wage difference as the amount workers must be "compensated" to accept the additional risk.\n\n3. This wage differential reveals how much people value reducing their risk of death (in monetary terms). If workers require $10,000 more to accept a 0.1% higher risk of death, this suggests they value a 1% reduction in mortality risk at $100,000.\n\nThe text calls these extrapolations "heroic" because:\n- It's an indirect way of measuring something very complex\n- It assumes workers have perfect information about risks\n- It assumes workers have free choice of occupation\n- It requires comparing otherwise similar jobs\n\nThis method, while imperfect, provides economists with a quantitative way to estimate how much people value mortality risk reduction, which is otherwise very difficult to measure directly.	2025-01-09 18:25:28.052255	null	0

More Inequality: When you look at any specific point in time and consider both health and income together, the gaps between countries appear larger than if you just looked at income differences alone.\n\n2. More Convergence: Over time, countries have been moving closer together more quickly when measuring both factors than when just measuring income.\n\nIn simpler terms, imagine:\n- If you only look at money (income), you see some differences between rich and poor countries\n- But if you look at both money AND how long people live (health), you see:\n  * Bigger gaps between countries at any given moment\n  * BUT these gaps have been closing faster over time (up until the 1990s)\n\nThis is important because it suggests that measuring a country's progress by income alone doesn't tell the whole story - including health metrics gives us a more complete (though more complex) picture of how countries are developing and how living standards are changing across the world.\n\nThe reference to Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) indicates this is based on their research findings, which developed these "compound welfare measures" to better understand global development patterns.	2025-01-09 18:27:40.970305	null	1

This highlights one of the major limitations of this theoretical approach. You're right that in reality, many dangerous jobs don't actually pay wages that truly reflect their risk levels. Here's why this is important:\n\nTheory vs. Reality Gap:\n- Theory assumes: Perfect labor markets where workers can freely choose jobs and employers must compensate fully for risk\n- Reality shows: Many dangerous jobs (construction, farming, fishing) often pay relatively low wages despite high risks\n\nReasons for the Mismatch:\n1. Power imbalances between workers and employers\n2. Limited job options for some workers due to education, location, or economic necessity\n3. Lack of perfect information about job risks\n4. Union strength/weakness affecting wage negotiation\n5. Immigration status and other vulnerabilities that limit worker bargaining power\n\nThis is why the text carefully notes these are "admittedly heroic extrapolations" - it's acknowledging that this method of calculation is based on theoretical assumptions that don't fully match reality. The word "heroic" here is actually a gentle academic way of saying "quite a stretch."\n\nThis limitation is one reason why workplace safety regulations are necessary - we can't rely solely on market forces to properly compensate for or prevent occupational risks.	2025-01-09 18:26:14.291758	null	0

Life expectancy at birth:\n- This is the average number of years a newborn baby would be expected to live under current mortality conditions\n- For example, when the text says life expectancy at birth increased by 30 years between 1841-1950, it means a newborn would be expected to live about 30 years longer in 1950 than in 1841\n\n2. Life expectancy at age 10:\n- This is the average number of additional years someone who has already reached age 10 could expect to live\n- It's different from life expectancy at birth because it only counts people who survived the risky early years\n- The calculation starts from age 10 rather than from birth\n\nThe key insight from the highlighted text is that mortality improvements were much more dramatic for young children than for older people. This makes sense because:\n- Many children used to die very young (especially from infectious diseases)\n- Once someone survived childhood, they had a better chance of living to an older age\n- When they say life expectancy at age 10 only increased by half as much, it shows that most of the gains in life expectancy came from preventing early childhood deaths rather than extending adult life	2025-01-09 18:33:52.518899	null	2

Let me point to specific evidence from the text that supports this:\n\n1. The text directly states that "The decline in infectious disease explains this disparate age pattern"\n\n2. Supporting statistics:\n- In 1848, 60% of deaths in England were from infectious disease\n- By 1971, infectious disease mortality had declined by 95%\n\n3. The age pattern evidence:\n- Between 1841-1950, life expectancy at birth increased by 30 years\n- But life expectancy at age 10 only increased by 15 years (half as much)\n- This difference shows that most lives were saved in those first 10 years of life\n\nThis pattern makes intuitive sense because:\n- Young children are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases\n- Once these diseases were controlled (through better sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics, etc.), many more children survived to adulthood\n- This had a huge impact on average life expectancy at birth, since fewer children were dying very young\n\nThis is a crucial insight for understanding the historical mortality transition in developed countries - the initial big gains came not from helping people live to be very old, but from helping them survive childhood.	2025-01-09 18:34:51.87112	null	2

In fact, the text presents several pieces of evidence showing a positive correlation between economic growth/income and life expectancy:\n\n1. Through the 20th century, growth in real incomes was accompanied by unprecedented declines in mortality rates in high-income countries, with life expectancy increasing by nearly 30 years.\n\n2. Figure 1 (the Preston Curve) shows a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy across countries.\n\n3. There is evidence of positive relationships between income and health within countries - for example, Americans in the bottom 5% of income distribution had life expectancy about 25% lower than those in the top 5%.\n\nHowever, the text does suggest some complexity in this relationship:\n\n1. Russia experienced a 7-year drop in life expectancy in the 1990s during its economic transition.\n\n2. In England during 1820-1870 (period of greatest industrialization), life expectancy remained stable at about 41 years despite economic growth.\n\n3. The HIV/AIDS epidemic and transitions in Russia and Eastern Europe have disrupted some of the previous patterns of convergence in life expectancy.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring why the connection might be tenuous, we'd need to look at other sections of the document or additional sources.	2025-01-09 18:37:42.291991	null	3

Variolation (early form of immunization):\n- Practiced in China as early as 10th century\n- Introduced to Europe from Turkey\n- Brought to American colonies by African slaves\n- Used by George Washington for his army\n\nModern Vaccination Timeline:\n- Started with Jenner at end of 18th century\n- Major research delayed until after germ theory (late 19th century)\n- Multiple vaccines developed from 1885-1981 (rabies, plague, diphtheria, etc.)\n\nLimited Impact on Mortality:\n1. In rich countries, direct mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases was relatively rare before vaccines were introduced\n- Example: Measles infected 500,000 people in US but caused fewer than 1,000 deaths\n\n2. Quantitative Impact:\n- Only 3% of total mortality reduction came from vaccine-preventable diseases (excluding TB)\n- TB accounts for another 10%, but the US never routinely used TB vaccine\n- Even widely used vaccines like BCG (for TB) in Britain showed no clear effect on mortality trends\n\nThe text suggests vaccines were more important for preventing morbidity (sickness) than mortality (death), though there might be indirect benefits through preventing weakened health conditions that could lead to other diseases.	2025-01-09 18:47:01.517129	null	6

Historical Timeline Discrepancy:\n- Life expectancy in England in 1600 was the same as in 1820, with 1750 being a low point\n- If we date the modern decrease in mortality from 1870, the timing doesn't align well with economic growth across countries\n- The onset of modern mortality decline is more clustered across countries than the beginnings of modern economic growth (according to Easterlin, 2004)\n\n2. Nutritional Evidence Contradictions:\n- English aristocrats, despite better nutrition, had no life expectancy advantage over the rest of the population from the 16th to 18th centuries\n- Well-fed populations (like the United States) during the same period did not show lower mortality rates\n\n3. Disease vs. Nutrition Debate:\n- There are complex two-way interactions between disease and nutrition\n- Some argue that disease, not nutrition (which would be linked to economic growth), was the primary factor affecting mortality\n- Public health interventions may have been more important than economic factors in changing disease burdens\n\n4. Physical Evidence:\n- Skeletal remains suggest people were taller (and presumably better nourished) in early medieval times (Steckel, 2004), contradicting a simple linear relationship between economic progress and health outcomes\n\nThese points suggest that the relationship between economic growth and mortality is more complex than a simple direct correlation would indicate, with public health interventions and disease control potentially playing more significant roles than pure economic factors.	2025-01-09 18:38:20.661171	null	4

The typical focus of aesthetic studies - emotional responses and feelings\n2. What psychoanalysts generally don't deal with in their work\n\nThe context suggests that while aesthetic studies typically examine emotional impulses (like our responses to beauty or art), psychoanalysts work in "other strata of the psyche." These emotional impulses that aesthetics studies are characterized in the text as being:\n- Restrained\n- Inhibited in their aims\n- Dependent on numerous attendant circumstances\n\nThis is important because Freud is establishing a contrast between:\n- The usual domain of aesthetics (emotional responses)\n- The usual domain of psychoanalysis (deeper psychological layers)\n\nThis sets up his later argument about why examining the "uncanny" is unusual but important - it's one of those rare cases where psychoanalysis and aesthetics overlap.	2025-01-09 22:52:02.353494	null	1

The "even when" is setting up a contrast that actually strengthens the author's point about how rarely psychoanalysts engage with aesthetics.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The basic statement is that psychoanalysts rarely engage in aesthetic investigations\n\n2. The "even when" introduces what should logically be a condition that would make psychoanalysts MORE likely to engage with aesthetics (since it relates to feelings, which is more in their wheelhouse)\n\n3. But the author is emphasizing that DESPITE this seemingly favorable condition (aesthetics being about feelings rather than just beauty), psychoanalysts still rarely engage with it\n\nIt's like saying "I rarely go to the beach, even when it's sunny and warm." The sunny and warm weather should make beach-going more likely, but the speaker is emphasizing that they still don't go much, making their aversion to beach-going seem even stronger.\n\nThis rhetorical structure helps Freud (the author) set up his larger point about how unusual it is for a psychoanalyst to engage with aesthetics, making his upcoming discussion of the uncanny feel more significant and noteworthy.	2025-01-09 23:07:20.082839	null	1
